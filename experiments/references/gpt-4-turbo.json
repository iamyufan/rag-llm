It is configured using the autoscaling_config field in deployment options, which includes settings for minimum and maximum replicas, initial replicas, and the target number of ongoing requests per replica. The autoscaler ensures each replica has roughly the specified number of requests being processed or waiting in the queue. The Ray Serve Autoscaler operates on top of the Ray Autoscaler, which manages the underlying resources by adding or removing nodes as needed.",

        "reasoning": "In the context of the supervised actor pattern, the supervisor is responsible for managing the lifecycle of its worker actors. If the supervisor fails, it typically means that the workers it supervises would also be terminated or fail, as they rely on the supervisor for fault tolerance and lifecycle management. Passing a reference of the worker actor to another actor does not inherently change this relationship or the fault tolerance properties of the system.

        "source": "https://docs.ray.io/en/master/data/api/doc/ray.data.read_images.html#ray-data-read-images",
        "answer": "The dependencies for the api read_images are: pyarrow.fs.FileSystem, ray.data.datasource.file_meta_provider.BaseFileMetadataProvider, ray.data.datasource.partitioning.PathPartitionFilter, ray.data.datasource.partitioning.Partitioning, numpy.ndarray.",
        "score": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "The response accurately lists the dependencies for the 'read_images' API based on the provided context, which includes classes and modules that are parameters to the function. The score is not a 5 because the response could be more specific by indicating that numpy is a dependency due to the return type of the images, not a direct parameter."

        "score": 1.0,
        "reasoning": "The context given is a navigation sidebar from the Ray documentation and does not include any content or instructions on how to kill a specific server replica. Therefore, the response does not answer the query due to the lack of relevant information in the provided context."

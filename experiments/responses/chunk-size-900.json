This can be helpful when dealing with type conversions during your data processing tasks. To avoid potential out-of-memory situations, ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large and that the output batch can fit comfortably into memory by adjusting the batch size accordingly.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `batch_format` for NumPy and pandas:\n\nNumPy:\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness, batch_format=\"numpy\")\n)\n```\n\npandas:\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport ray\n\ndef drop_nas(batch: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    return batch.dropna()\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_csv(\"s3://anonymous@air-example-data/iris.csv\")\n    .map_batches(drop_nas, batch_format=\"pandas\")\n)\n```\n\nTo inspect batches, you can use the `Dataset.take_batch()` method, which allows you to specify the batch format as well.",

            "answer": " Ray Serve's autoscaling feature automatically adjusts the number of replicas in a deployment based on its workload. The Ray Serve autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that runs on top of the Ray autoscaler. It requests a number of replica actors from Ray based on demand, and if there aren't enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray autoscaler will request more Ray nodes from the cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down, it tries to terminate replica actors in a way that allows the Ray autoscaler to remove nodes with no Ray actors or tasks running on them. The autoscaler considers logical resource requests for scaling and not physical machine utilization. Autoscaling can reduce workload costs but adds node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure. It is recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters if you're new to Ray.",

Ray is a high-performance distributed execution system that is designed to handle large-scale machine learning and graph processing workloads, and it can be used as a scheduler for Dask, allowing you to use Dask's collections and execute the underlying tasks on a Ray cluster. Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing, it provides advanced scheduling and parallelization capabilities, and it can be used to scale the NumPy and Pandas APIs to large datasets and multi-node clusters. Dask-on-Ray allows you to use Dask and Ray libraries in the same application without having two different clusters, and it's well suited for batch processing workloads with a streaming paradigm that is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference. RayDP combines your Spark and Ray clusters, making it easy to do large scale data processing using the PySpark API and seamlessly use that data to train your models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.",

If the issue persists even after waiting for about 1 minute, it is possible that the dashboard or dashboard agent may have failed to start.\n\nIn case you have already verified the above and set the environment variable `RAY_ADDRESS` to `\"http://127.0.0.1:8265\"`, you can use the Jobs CLI on your local machine to interact with your remote Ray cluster. To connect to a running Ray cluster with a remote node as the head node, you can create a Pool with the `ray_address` parameter set to the IP address and port of your remote Ray cluster.\n\nFor instance, if your remote Ray cluster's head node IP address is `10.0.0.1` and the port is `8265`, you can create a Pool as follows:\n\n```python\npool = Pool(ray_address=\"10.0.0.1:8265\")\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can start Ray manually by calling `ray.init()` before creating a Pool.",

A batch is a user-facing object that represents a group of data points used to compute and apply one gradient update to the model weights during training. On the other hand, a block is an internal abstraction used by Ray Data to partition rows into distributed data blocks for parallel processing. Each block contains a disjoint subset of rows, and Ray Data loads and transforms these blocks in parallel. A Dataset operates over a sequence of Ray object references to blocks. A large block size can lead to potential out-of-memory situations, so it's essential to ensure that no single item in your Ray Data is too large and to call ds.map\\_batches() with a small enough batch size to fit the output batch comfortably into memory.",

Alternatively, you can install dependencies dynamically while Ray is running using runtime environments. A runtime environment describes the dependencies your Ray application needs to run, including files, packages, environment variables, and more. It is installed dynamically on the cluster at runtime and cached for future use.\n4. You can also install packages using setup\\_commands in the Ray Cluster configuration file. These commands will be run as each node joins the cluster.\n5. For hosting a runtime\\_env dependency remotely, you can use GitHub and specify it in a ray.init() or .options() call.\n\nNote: This feature requires a full installation of Ray using pip install \"ray[default]\" and is available starting with Ray 1.4.0, currently supported on macOS and Linux, with beta support on Windows.",

When using `map_batches()`, set `zero_copy_batch=True` if your function does not mutate its input. This will improve performance and decrease memory utilization.\n\nHere's an example using a numpy array in the context of the given `add_dog_years` function:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef add_dog_years(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"age_in_dog_years\"] = 7 * batch[\"age\"]\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.from_items([\n        {\"name\": \"Luna\", \"age\": np.array([4])},\n        {\"name\": \"Rory\", \"age\": np.array([14])},\n        {\"name\": \"Scout\", \"age\": np.array([9])},\n    ])\n    .map_batches(add_dog_years, zero_copy_batch=True)\n)\n\nds.show()\n```\n\nThis will create a Ray DataFrame with zero-copy reads for the numpy arrays in the object store. Note that if you need to mutate the numpy arrays within the function, you will need to create a copy of the array first, as they are read-only when deserialized as arguments in remote functions.",

            "answer": " To make a Ray Tune trial retry on failures, you can use the `failure_config` argument in the `RunConfig` class when creating a `Tuner` object. Specifically, you can set the `max_failures` parameter in `failure_config` to specify the maximum number of times a trial should be retried if it encounters a failure. Here is an example:\n```\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    train_model,\n    param_space=trial_space,\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        storage_path=os.path.expanduser(\"~/ray_results\"),\n        name=\"trial_fault_tolerance\",\n        failure_config=train.FailureConfig(max_failures=3),\n    ),\n)\nresults = tuner.fit()\n```\nThis will retry a trial up to 3 times if it encounters a failure. You can also use the `fail_fast` parameter in `failure_config` to stop the entire experiment immediately if any trial encounters a runtime error. For example:\n```\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    my_failing_trainable,\n    param_space={\"should_fail\": tune.grid_search([True, False])},\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(\n        failure_config=train.FailureConfig(fail_fast=True)\n    ),\n)\nresult_grid = tuner.fit()\n```\nThis will stop the experiment immediately if any trial encounters a runtime error.",

Here's an example:\n```python\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://<bucket>/<folder>/<text_file>.txt\")\n```\nIf the S3 bucket is private, you need to provide the access key, secret key, and session token (if applicable) using `pyarrow.fs.S3FileSystem`.

These functions return an ObjectRef, which is a pointer to an application value that can be stored anywhere in the cluster. Remote objects are immutable and can be replicated in multiple object stores without needing to synchronize the copies.\n\nAdditionally, when creating objects in the object store via `ray.put()` or returning values from remote functions, the objects will be stored in the object store memory. Objects are reference counted and evicted when they fall out of scope. Object spilling to external storage will occur once the capacity of the object store is used up, which enables out-of-core data processing for memory-intensive distributed applications.\n\nIt's worth noting that to avoid overloading the driver node, it's preferable to have each task write out the predictions directly to the storage system instead of returning results back to the driver.",

Here is an example:\n```\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n```\nBy default, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled. If you want to make progress in cases where application-level code may cause memory leaks on a worker after repeated task executions, you can set the `max_calls` option in a task's `@ray.remote` decorator. Once a worker has executed this many invocations of the given remote function, it will automatically exit.\n\nNote that cancellation in Ray is best-effort and not always guaranteed. You can check if a task was successfully cancelled using `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`. When the `recursive=True` argument is given to `ray.cancel()`, it cancels all child and Actor Tasks.",

First, install TensorFlow 2 and requests in your Databricks environment:\n\n```bash\npip install \"tensorflow>=2.0\" requests\n```\n\n2. Follow the example of distributed training of a TensorFlow model on MNIST with Ray Train provided in the context. Adapt your custom neural net code to the TensorFlow multi-worker with Keras example.\n\n3. Use the `TensorflowTrainer` class from `ray.train.tensorflow` and the `ScalingConfig` class from `ray.train.core` to configure and launch your distributed training job.\n\n4. In your training function, access Ray datasets using `get_dataset_shard` to shard data across workers.\n\nKeep in mind that Ray Serve is framework-agnostic, so you can use any version of TensorFlow or Keras. However, the provided example uses TensorFlow 2 and Keras.\n\nFor more information and examples, refer to the RayDP Github page: <https://github.com/oap-project/raydp>",

You can define async methods in Ray actors and use them alongside popular async frameworks like aiohttp, aioredis, etc. When calling an async actor method, the operation immediately returns a promise/future, which is essentially an identifier of the operation\u2019s result. To get the actual results, you need to call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results. However, calling `ray.get()` blocks the driver program from invoking other operations, which can hurt parallelism. To avoid this, you can use `async ray.get` and `asyncio.run` to get the results without blocking the driver program. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# regular ray.get\n# ray.get([actor.run_concurrent.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n\n# async ray.get\nasync def async_get():\n    await actor.run_concurrent.remote()\n\nasyncio.run(async_get())\n```\nThis allows you to use Ray with async/await syntax without blocking the driver program.",

Instead, separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to remote functions, so all remote functions are spawned before waiting for the results and can run in parallel in the background.\n\nYou can also pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` to wait for all tasks to finish at once. Additionally, avoid calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily for intermediate steps; work with object references directly and only call `ray.get()` at the end to get the final result.\n\nTo further investigate the issue, you can use Ray's debugger to set breakpoints and inspect the code execution. For example, you can run `ray debug` and then insert a breakpoint at the `ray.get()` call, which will allow you to examine the function's behavior and identify the cause of the hanging.",

For example, to get the actor ID, you can define an actor class with a method that calls `ray.get_runtime_context().get_actor_id`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def log_info(self):\n        runtime_context = ray.get_runtime_context()\n        actor_id = runtime_context.get_actor_id()\n        print(f\"Actor ID: {actor_id}\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `log_info` method of the `MyActor` class logs the actor ID using the `print()` function. This log message will be available in the Actor logs.\n\nNote that logs of asynchronous Actor Tasks or threaded Actor Tasks (concurrency>1) are only available as part of the Actor logs.

Import the module and decorate your Actor class with `@ray.remote` in your main script:\n```python\n# main.py\nimport ray\nimport my_module\n\nray.init()\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Counter(object):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.n = 0\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.n += 1\n\n    def read(self):\n        return self.n\n\n# Distribute the custom module across the Ray cluster\nray.put(my_module)\n\n# Create actors and perform operations\ncounters = [Counter.remote() for i in range(4)]\n[c.increment.remote() for c in counters]\nfutures = [c.read.remote() for c in counters]\n\n# Load the custom module in the remote worker\nid_my_module = ray.put(my_module)\nmy_module_on_worker = ray.get_actor(counters[0])._core_worker.global_worker.ray_actor_get_object_id.remote(id_my_module)\n\n# Use the custom module in the remote worker\nmy_function_on_worker = ray.get_actor(counters[0])._core_worker.global_worker.ray_worker_get_remote.remote(my_module_on_worker, \"my_module.my_function\")\nprint(ray.get(my_function_on_worker.remote()))  # \"Hello from my module!\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we first distribute the `my_module.py` using `ray.put()`. Then, we load the module in the remote worker and call the `my_function()` function. Note that this method is not officially supported and might not work in all cases. It is recommended to use this approach with caution and test it thoroughly.",

To see `log.info` messages, you can either modify the Ray logger's logging level to `logging.DEBUG` or set it to a custom level that includes `INFO` level messages.\n\nHere's an example of how to modify the Ray logger's logging level to `logging.DEBUG`:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"ray\")\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\nThis will configure the Ray logger to display `DEBUG` level messages and above, including `INFO` level messages.\n\nAdditionally, Ray logs are written to files in the directory `/tmp/ray/session_*/logs` on each Ray node's file system. You can check these log files to see if the `log.info` messages are being recorded.

This can be useful for avoiding contention between workers when saving trial-level outputs. For example:\n\n```\nos.environ[\"RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR\"] = \"0\"\ntuner = tune.Tuner(train_func)\ntuner.fit()\n```\n\nIn this case, any outputs should be saved to the trial directory using `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` as the path.",

However, you can make changes to the files on your local machine and re-run the Ray job, which will then upload the updated files to the cluster.\n\nAdditionally, you can use Ray's built-in support for file mounts to automatically synchronize a local directory with a directory on the cluster nodes. This can be done by specifying the `filemounts` configuration in your Ray cluster's YAML file. For example:\n```yaml\nfilemounts:\n  - source_path: /path/to/local/directory\n    target_path: /path/on/cluster/directory\n    options:\n      rw: true\n```\nThis will mount the local directory at `/path/to/local/directory` to the cluster node's directory at `/path/on/cluster/directory`, allowing for automatic synchronization of files between the two.\n\nKeep in mind that updating the files in the local directory and re-running the Ray job or using file mounts will not update the working directory hash, which is generated based on the contents of the directory at the time of the initial upload. If you need to update the hash, you will need to re-run `ray.init()` with the updated working directory.",

It runs on the head node and stores data in-memory. The GCS is not fault tolerant by default, but it can be made fault tolerant using HA Redis. The GCS takes up a lot of memory on the head node because it stores all the cluster-level metadata in memory. If the GCS is taking up too much memory, it may be necessary to adjust the memory usage of other memory-demanding system components on the head node, such as the dashboard or the driver. It may also be helpful to not run any tasks and actors on the head node and to specify --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node. In Ray 2.0, KubeRay added experimental support for GCS fault tolerance, which can prevent the Ray cluster from crashing if the head node goes down.",

            "answer": " To track an uncaught exception in Ray Serve, you can handle the relevant Ray exceptions in your application code. Specifically, you can handle `RayTaskError` for uncaught task-level exceptions and `RaySystemError` for system-level errors. Here's an example of how to handle these exceptions:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import serve\nfrom ray.exceptions import RayTaskError, RaySystemError\n\n@serve.deployment\nclass MyService:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.counter = 0\n\n    async def handle_request(self, request):\n        try:\n            # Process request\n            result = some_function_that_might_fail()\n        except RayTaskError as e:\n            # Handle task-level exceptions\n            print(f\"RayTaskError: {e}\")\n        except RaySystemError as e:\n            # Handle system-level errors\n            print(f\"RaySystemError: {e}\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            # Handle other exceptions\n            print(f\"Unexpected error: {e}\")\n\n        return result\n\nserve.run(MyService.bind())\n```\n\nIn this example, `some_function_that_might_fail()` is a placeholder for your actual request handling code, which might raise exceptions. The `try`-`except` block catches and handles the relevant Ray exceptions, as well as other exceptions.\n\nKeep in mind that Ray Serve also provides built-in monitoring and logging features, such as logging to stdout and stderr, which you can use to track exceptions and other events in your application.",

Note that this feature requires a full installation of Ray using `pip install \"ray[default]\"`. The logs are organized by node and log file name, and the Logs view provides search functionality to help you find specific log messages.\n\nIf you are running Ray Jobs, worker logs of Ray Jobs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while driver logs are captured only for Ray Jobs submitted via Jobs API. In this case, you can find the captured driver logs with the Dashboard UI, CLI, or Python SDK.\n\nFor parsing and searching the logs, you can find a copy of these logs at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/`, and you can use a logging stack such as ELK or Loki to search by deployment or replica.

However, you mentioned that the node is still up and running, so it's possible that the GCS server is temporarily unavailable but will recover.\n\nDuring the recovery period of the GCS server, certain functions will not be available, such as actor creation, deletion and reconstruction, placement group creation, deletion and reconstruction, resource management, worker node registration, and worker process creation. However, running Ray tasks and actors will remain alive and any existing objects will continue to be available.\n\nIf you're using KubeRay, you can enable GCS fault tolerance by adding an external Redis server and modifying your RayService Kubernetes object.\n\nIf the worker node cannot connect to the head node, you should check the error messages for more information. The most likely cause is that the worker node cannot access the IP address given. You can use the `ip route get xx.xx.xx.xx` command on the worker node to start debugging routing issues.\n\nIf the worker init container is stuck in the Init:0/1 status, some common causes include the GCS server process failing in the head Pod, the ray executable not being included in the $PATH for the image, the CLUSTER_DOMAIN environment variable not being set correctly, or sharing certain settings between the worker init container and the worker Pod template causing a deadlock.",

Additionally, you can specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices. However, if the objects you are working with are too large to fit in memory even after configuration changes, spilling is likely unavoidable for out-of-core data processing. To monitor spilling, you can check the raylet logs or use the `ray memory` command to view cluster-wide spill stats.",

You can do this by using the `ray.get_actor()` function and providing the ACTOR\\_ID of the replica. In your case, the ACTOR\\_ID is \"SERVE\\_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\".\n2. Once you have the replica handle, you can use the `ray.kill()` function to kill the replica. Set the `no_restart` parameter to `True` to prevent the replica from automatically restarting.\n\nHere's an example command to kill the specific replica:\n```python\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\nNote that you can get the list of all actors and their corresponding ACTOR\\_IDs by running the command `ray list actors`.",

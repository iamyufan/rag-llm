Dask is more flexible and can be used for a wider range of tasks. It's designed to integrate with Python-based data science stacks like Pandas and Numpy. Ray, on the other hand, is focused on providing a universal framework for distributed computing, making it ideal for machine learning tasks. It's also designed to be highly scalable.",

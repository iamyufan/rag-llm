The Ray autoscaler, which controls this process, runs on the head node and responds to task and actor resource requests, increasing or decreasing the number of worker nodes as needed. It's important to note that the autoscaler reacts to resource demands and not application metrics or physical resource utilization.\n\nThe Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that works on top of the Ray Autoscaler. It requests a number of replica actors based on the demand from requests, and the Ray Autoscaler adjusts the number of Ray nodes accordingly.\n\nAutoscaling can help reduce workload costs but may introduce node launch overheads and configuration challenges. It's recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters for new Ray users.\n\nIn the context of Kubernetes, the Ray autoscaler makes scaling decisions based on logical resources expressed in task and actor annotations, similar to the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler.",

Dask is a flexible framework for parallel computing that is built on top of Python's NumPy and Pandas libraries, allowing for the use of familiar APIs for large-scale data processing. Dask can be used on Ray to take advantage of its scheduling and execution capabilities. Ray Data, a part of Ray, handles many batch processing workloads similar to Spark but with a streaming paradigm that is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference.

However, it does mention that the example uses a GPU instance with 24 GB of GPU memory (A10G) and utilizes DeepSpeed to reduce GPU memory usage.\n\nTo ensure that your model fits into the GPU memory, you should consider the following:\n\n1. Make sure your GPU has enough memory to accommodate the model. If you have a GPU with less than 24 GB of memory, you may need to consider using DeepSpeed or a cloud-based solution with sufficient GPU memory.\n2. Adjust the batch size to fit the model into the GPU memory. If the batch size is too large, your program might run out of memory. You can decrease the batch size if you encounter an out-of-memory error.\n\nIn summary, while the context does not provide a specific memory size recommendation, it suggests using a GPU instance with 24 GB of GPU memory and DeepSpeed to accommodate the large model size.

Cluster termination due to user action can also result in node death.\n\nTo tolerate head node failures, we need to make GCS fault-tolerant so that when a new head node starts, we still have all the cluster-level data.

You can prepare a single environment across the cluster before starting the Ray runtime using the Ray Cluster launcher. You can build all your files and dependencies into a container image and specify this in your Cluster YAML Configuration.\n3. Alternatively, you can install dependencies dynamically while Ray is running. A runtime environment describes the dependencies your Ray application needs to run, including files, packages, environment variables, and more.\n4. To specify environment dependencies for tasks and actors on remote machines, you can use runtime environments to install them on the fly or prepare them in advance using the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n5. If you're developing Ray, you can create a Docker image that has your Ray repo pre-cloned and replace the pip installs with a git checkout of your desired commit.\n\nNote: The above steps are a summary of the information provided in the context.

The ObjectRefGenerator can be passed to another task or used to iterate over the return values.\n\nTo retrieve an object from an ObjectRef, you can use the `ray.get` function, as shown in the example:\n\n```python\narray_size = ray.get(get_size.remote(dynamic_ref))\n```\n\nIn this case, `get_size` is a remote function, and `dynamic_ref` is an ObjectRef.

Class variables not supported for sharing state between instances.\n2. Each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, so each actor will have its own copy of the class variables.\n3. If you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks.\n4.

In C++, named actors can be scoped by job, meaning the actor name is only valid within the job and cannot be accessed from another job.

We want to apply a function `process_image` to each image in the dataset, which will perform some processing on the image and return a modified NumPy array.\n\nFirst, we define the `process_image` function:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef process_image(image: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:\n    # Perform some processing on the image\n    processed_image = ...\n    return processed_image\n```\nNext, we apply this function to each row in the dataset using `map`:\n```python\nds_processed = ds.map(process_image)\n```\nThis will create a new Ray Dataset `ds_processed` that contains the processed image data.\n\nNote that `map` applies the function to each row of the dataset independently, so it can be a good choice if the function is vectorized or can be easily parallelized. However, if the function requires access to multiple rows at once or needs to perform some aggregation, `map_batches` might be a better choice.",

This function returns the state of the actor as a dictionary, or `None` if the actor is not found. Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import get_actor\n\nactor_state = get_actor(id=\"<ACTOR_ID>\")\nprint(actor_state)\n```\nNote that the `RuntimeContext.actor_id` property is deprecated and may be removed in future Ray releases. It is recommended to use `get_actor_id` instead.\n\nTo get the details of an actor, including its ID, name, and node IP, you can use the Ray web interface. To do this, first get the actor ID as described above. Then, open the Ray web interface in a web browser and navigate to the Actor Detail page for the actor by clicking on its ID.

If you want to kill an actor forcefully, you can use the `ray.kill()` function. This will interrupt any running tasks on the actor, causing them to fail immediately. If you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case.",

Here's an example:\n```python\nb = ray.get(a)  # where a is an object reference\n```\nIn the context of tasks, you should use `ray.put()` to store the argument to the object store once and get an ObjectRef, then pass the argument reference to tasks. This way, you ensure all tasks use the same copy of the argument, which is faster and uses less object store memory. Here's an example:\n```python\na = ray.put(None)\nb = f.remote([a])  # passing the object reference to a task\n```\n`ray.wait()` is used to wait for a list of object references to complete and return a list of IDs that are ready and a list of IDs that are not. Here's an example:\n```python\nobject_refs = [some_object_ref, another_object_ref]\nready_ids, not_ready_ids = ray.wait(object_refs)\n```",

            "answer": " To preprocess many files using Ray Data, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Initialize Ray and create a Ray Dataset from your files. Ray Data supports creating datasets from various sources and file formats.\n2. Preprocess your Ray Dataset using operations like `map_batches()` to transform your data.\n3. If your preprocessed Dataset is small enough to fit in Ray's object store memory, materialize it in the object store using `materialize()`. This will pin the preprocessed data in memory, so you won't need to re-run preprocessing operations when iterating over the dataset repeatedly.\n\nHere's a code example demonstrating these steps:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Create a Ray Dataset from files\ndataset = ray.data.read_csv('path/to/your/files/*.csv')\n\n# Preprocess your Ray Dataset\ndef preprocess_batch(batch):\n    # Add your preprocessing code here\n    pass\n\ndataset = dataset.map_batches(preprocess_batch)\n\n# Materialize the preprocessed dataset if it's small enough\nif dataset.count() < (0.3 * ray.cluster_resources()['memory_total_mb']):\n    dataset.materialize()\n```\n\nThis example assumes you are reading CSV files. Replace `'path/to/your/files/*.csv'` with the actual path to your files. Add your preprocessing code inside the `preprocess_batch()` function. If your preprocessed dataset is small enough, call `materialize()` to pin it in memory.",

Ray Datasets allow you to perform scalable offline batch inference with Torch models by mapping a pre-trained model over your data, as shown in the example provided. The example uses a PyTorch model, but you can adapt it to use other frameworks or custom code. The key is to define the inference logic in a function and then use the `map_batches()` method to apply this logic to the dataset.",

However, note that using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported in Ray, as each actor instance is instantiated in its own process, and each actor will have its own copy of the class variables.\n2. Pass the variable as an argument to the methods that need it, instead of storing it as an instance variable.\n3. If the variable needs to be shared between multiple actors, consider using a separate global actor to manage the shared state.\n\nHere's an example of the third option:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass GlobalVarActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.global_var = None\n\n    def set_global_var(self, var):\n        self.global_var = var\n\n    def get_global_var(self):\n        return self.global_var\n\nglobal_var_actor = GlobalVarActor.remote()\nray.get(global_var_actor.set_global_var.remote(4))\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self, global_var_actor):\n        self.global_var_actor = global_var_actor\n\n    def f(self):\n        return ray.get(self.global_var_actor.get_global_var.remote()) + 3\n\nactor = Actor.remote(global_var_actor)\nassert ray.get(actor.f.remote()) == 7\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a separate `GlobalVarActor` to manage the shared state.

Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible.\n3. Create a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`.\n4. Be cautious when running tests in parallel.\n\nFor Java Ray code, you can use the Ray Java API and import necessary classes, and for testing Ray serving, you can use RayServeHandle inside Ray.\n\nHere's an example of how to write a unit test for Ray code in Python:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_my_ray_code(self):\n        # Test your Ray code here\n        pass\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of how to write a unit test for Ray serving:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray import serve\n\nclass RayServeTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n        serve.start()\n\n    def test_my_ray_serve_code(self):\n        # Test your Ray serving code here\n        pass\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the `# Test your Ray code here` and `# Test your Ray serving code here` comments with your actual test code.",

            "answer": " To perform a global shuffle with Ray, you can use the `random_shuffle()` function on a Ray Data dataset. This function randomly shuffles the rows of the dataset. However, note that this can be a slow operation for large datasets. For better performance, consider iterating over batches with shuffling.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `random_shuffle()`:\n```\nimport ray\n\n# Create a Ray Data dataset\nds = ray.data.range(100)\n\n# Randomly shuffle the dataset\nshuffled_ds = ds.random_shuffle()\n\n# Take the first 3 elements of the shuffled dataset\nprint(shuffled_ds.take(3))\n```\nIf you want to enable the experimental push-based shuffle, you can do so by setting the `RAY_DATA_PUSH_BASED_SHUFFLE` environment variable to `1` when running your application. You can also specify the shuffle implementation during program execution by using the `DataContext.use_push_based_shuffle` flag.\n\nFor more information on shuffle performance and tuning, see the Ray Data documentation on performance tips and tuning.",

If the namespace is not specified, it defaults to the current namespace.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `ray.get_actor()` to find an Actor in a specific namespace:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Connect to the cluster with the desired namespace\nray.init(namespace=\"desired_namespace\")\n\n# Get a handle to the Actor\nactor_handle = ray.get_actor(\"actor_name\", namespace=\"desired_namespace\")\n```\nNote that if you don't know the namespace of the Actor, you may need to iterate over all namespaces and check if the Actor exists in each one. However, this can be inefficient and may not be feasible for large clusters with many namespaces.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to note that actors are only accessible within their namespaces, and each job has its own namespace by default. If you're having trouble finding an actor, make sure you're connecting to the correct namespace and that the actor has not been deleted.",

However, `ray.get()` blocks the driver program from invoking other operations, which can hurt parallelism.\n\nRay natively integrates with asyncio, allowing the use of async/await syntax and popular async frameworks like aiohttp and aioredis. To use asyncio with Ray, you can define async methods in an actor class, annotated with `@ray.remote`. Only one task can be running at any point in time in async actors, and there will be only one thread in the `AsyncActor` class.\n\nHere's an example of defining an async actor:\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_task(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # Network, I/O task here\n        print(\"ended\")\n```\n\nIn this example, `ray.get()` is not allowed in async actors because it would block the execution of the event loop. Instead, you can use `asyncio.run(async_get())` to run the async function.",

            "answer": " To debug a hanging `ray.get()` call, there are a few things to consider. First, `ray.get()` is a blocking call, which means it waits until the requested result is available. If you call `ray.get()` in a loop, it can harm parallelism since the loop will not continue until the call to `ray.get()` is resolved.\n\nIn your case, the issue might be that you are not instantiating the recv side call for the `do_send` remote function. This can cause the `ray.get()` call to hang.\n\nTo avoid this issue, you can separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This way, all remote functions are spawned before you wait for the results, allowing them to run in parallel in the background. Additionally, you can pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` instead of calling it one by one to wait for all of the tasks to finish.\n\nHere's an example of how you can modify your code to avoid the hanging `ray.get()` call:\n```python\n# Instantiate the recv side call for the remote function\nresult_ref = A.do_send.remote(target_rank=1)\n\n# Spawn all remote functions before waiting for the results\nobject_references = [result_ref]\n\n# Wait for all tasks to finish\nresults = ray.get(object_references)\n```\nBy following this pattern, you can ensure that all remote functions are spawned before waiting for the results, allowing them to run in parallel in the background.",

Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\n\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\nNote that this method of termination waits until any previously submitted tasks finish executing and then exits the process gracefully with `sys.exit()`.

This will decrement the reference count for the actor handle and, if the reference count reaches 0, the actor will be terminated.\n\nFor example:\n```\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\ndel replica_handle\n```\nNote that if your program has multiple references to the same actor handle, the actor will not be terminated until the reference count for the actor handle reaches 0. See the Python documentation for more context about object deletion.\n\nYou can also use the `os.kill()` function to send a signal to the actor process and forcefully terminate it, but this should be reserved for cases where an actor is unexpectedly hanging or leaking resources.\n\nFor example:\n```\nimport os\nos.kill(pid, signal.SIGKILL)\n```\nWhere `pid` is the process ID of the actor process.",

You would need to use the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to provision nodes for Ray pods, and configure the Ray Autoscaler to make decisions about scaling the Ray pods based on resource demand. This approach lacks the built-in autoscaling feature provided by KubeRay.\n\nTo enable Ray autoscaling with Kubernetes, you need Ray 1.10 or higher and KubeRay v0.3.0+. You can follow the KubeRay quickstart guide to install the necessary tools, prepare a Kubernetes cluster, and deploy a KubeRay operator. Then, you can create an autoscaling RayCluster custom resource using the provided configuration sample. The KubeRay operator will then automatically configure an autoscaling sidecar container for the Ray head pod, which collects resource metrics and adjusts the number of Ray worker replicas as needed.",

Then, in your Ray script, initialize Ray with the `py_modules` field:\n```python\nimport ray\nimport my_module\n\nray.init(\"ray://123.456.7.89:10001\", runtime_env={\"py_modules\": [my_module]})\n\n@ray.remote\ndef test_my_module():\n    my_module.test()\n```\n1. Now, you can use the `test_my_module` remote function in your Ray program, and the custom module `my_module` will be available for the Actor to use.\n\nRegarding pushing a custom actor module, the process is similar. When you define the actor class, Ray will automatically distribute it across the cluster.

To see these messages, you can modify the Ray logger's configuration to set the logging level to `logging.DEBUG` or lower.\n\nHere's an example of how to modify the Ray logger's configuration:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"ray\")\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n```\n\nThis will set the logging level for the Ray logger to `logging.DEBUG`, which will display all messages, including `log.info` messages, in the Ray logs.\n\nNote that modifying the Ray logger's configuration will affect all Ray loggers, including those used by Ray libraries. If you want to modify the logging configuration for a specific Ray library, you can specify the appropriate logger name instead of \"ray\".\n\nAlso, keep in mind that worker logs of Ray Jobs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via Jobs API. If you execute the Driver directly on the Head Node of the Ray Cluster or run with Ray Client, the Driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard, and you should check the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output to view the Driver logs.",

Ensure that the dashboard port is properly forwarded to your local machine. You can customize the port using the `--dashboard-port` argument when starting the Ray cluster.\n2. Verify that the Ray Dashboard is running and accessible via the head node's IP address and the specified port.\n3. Make sure that you have the necessary authentication in place to avoid any potential security issues.\n4. If the issue persists, consider integrating Prometheus and Grafana with the Ray Dashboard for enhanced monitoring and debugging capabilities.\n\nKeep in mind that the Ray Dashboard is essential for monitoring and debugging Ray applications and clusters, and it is highly recommended to set up Prometheus and Grafana for critical features such as Metrics View.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please refer to the Ray Dashboard documentation for more information on configuring and managing the dashboard: <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/dashboard.html>",

This allows you to share data between different parts of your Ray application, even if they have different working directories.\n\nFor example, you can use `ray.put()` to save a file to the object store:\n\n```python\nwith open(\"my_file.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n    file_content = f.read()\nray.put(\"my_file.txt\", file_content)\n```\n\nThen, you can use `ray.get()` to retrieve the file from the object store and write it to the new working directory:\n\n```python\nnew_file_content = ray.get(\"my_file.txt\")\nwith open(\"new_my_file.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(new_file_content)\n```\n\nNote that the `ray.put()` and `ray.get()` functions are designed to work with data, not files. If you need to share entire files between different parts of your Ray application, you may need to use a different approach, such as using a shared file system or uploading the files to a cloud storage service.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to change the working directory of the Ray workers, you can use the `runtime_env` argument when calling `ray.init()` to specify a different working directory. For example:\n\n```python\nray.init(runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"new_working_directory\"})\n```\n\nThis will change the working directory of the Ray workers to `new_working_directory`. However, keep in mind that this will not affect the working directory of the Ray driver (i.e., the process that calls `ray.init()`). To change the working directory of the Ray driver, you will need to use the `os.chdir()` function from the Python standard library.\n\nI hope this helps!

It stores data in-memory, which means it can take up a significant amount of memory on the head node. If your GCS server is taking up too much memory, you may need to adjust the max file descriptors limit per process via the ulimit command or consider using HA Redis for fault tolerance, which allows the GCS to load data from the Redis instance and resume regular functions during recovery. Additionally, you can prevent out-of-memory problems on the head node by not running any tasks and actors on it and specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node.",

Here are some steps to debug this issue:\n\n1. Check the Kubernetes cluster's resources and ensure they are sufficient for the Ray application.\n2. Inspect the recent failures and pending nodes using `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`.\n3. Increase Docker resource limits if the pods are stuck in the Pending state.\n4. If using Kubernetes with Ray, you can refer to the Ray on Kubernetes documentation for troubleshooting tips.\n5. If the issue persists, try restarting the Ray cluster with the `--restart-only` flag to avoid running any installation commands.\n6. If your program freezes, you can kill a random node and wait for Tune to continue the trials on a different worker node.\n7. You can also specify a storage path for uploading results to cloud storage like S3 for persisting results.\n\nIn summary, insufficient resources and configuration issues are the most common causes of pending nodes when starting a Ray cluster. Carefully checking the Kubernetes cluster's resources, recent failures, and Docker resource limits can help identify and resolve the issue.",

Test your Ray Serve script locally or in a RayCluster before deploying it to a RayService. Refer to rayserve-dev-doc.md for more details.\n2. Handle application-level failures by catching errors, retrying failed code, and handling misbehaving code using task and actor fault tolerance mechanisms.\n3. Leverage Ray logging to understand system-level behavior and surface application-level details during runtime. Ray Serve uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session\\_latest/logs/serve/. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, making it convenient for debugging.\n4. Check the Serve applications in the Ray dashboard to observe system-level failures like node failures. Ray can automatically recover from some failures in the distributed object store.",

For example, to create a new dataset with the first 100 rows from the original dataset, you can use:\n\n```\nsubset_dataset = ray.data.range(100).union(original_dataset)\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `take()` method to extract a fixed number of rows from the original dataset as a list of dictionaries, and then create a new Ray Dataset from that list. For example:\n\n```\nsubset_data = original_dataset.take(100)\nsubset_dataset = ray.data.from_items(subset_data)\n```\n\nYou can also use the `filter()` method to create a new dataset with a subset of the rows from the original dataset that satisfy a given condition. For example, to create a new dataset with only the rows where the value of the `\"y\"` key is greater than 10, you can use:\n\n```\nsubset_dataset = original_dataset.filter(lambda row: row[\"y\"] > 10)\n```\n\nIn addition, you can use the `split()` method to divide the original dataset into multiple smaller datasets, which can be useful for training machine learning models on large datasets. For example, to split the original dataset into a training set and a validation set, you can use:\n\n```\ntrain_dataset, validation_dataset = original_dataset.split(frac=0.8)\n```\n\nThis will create a training set with 80% of the rows from the original dataset, and a validation set with the remaining 20% of the rows.",

However, Ray, the underlying framework, provides a way to limit concurrency using the `max_concurrency` flag in the `@ray.remote` decorator when defining a Ray actor.\n\nHere's an example of how to limit concurrency to 2:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(max_concurrency=2)\nclass MyActor:\n    def map_batches(self, batches):\n        # Your code here\n        pass\n\nactor = MyActor.remote()\nactor.map_batches.remote(batches)\n```\n\nHowever, note that limiting concurrency in this way is not recommended for adjusting how many tasks can run concurrently, as it can hurt scheduling performance. Ray automatically decides task parallelism based on resource availability. A better approach is to modify each task\u2019s resource requirements instead.\n\nThe `map_batches` function you provided doesn't seem to be a Ray actor, but if it were, this is how you could limit concurrency.",

For example, you can run the following command to get the allocatable CPU resources for each node:\n```\nkubectl get nodes -o custom-columns=NODE:.metadata.name,ALLOCATABLE_CPU:.status.allocatable.cpu\n```\nThis will display the name of each node and the number of allocatable CPUs.\n\nIn the context provided, the Ray cluster has 1 head Pod with 4 physical CPUs and 1 worker Pod with 1 CPU.

Here's an example for Horovod:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.train.horovod import HorovodConfig\n\nhorovod_config = HorovodConfig(timeout_s=300)\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to set a timeout for a specific task or function, you can use the `ray.get()` function with a specified timeout. If the task does not complete within the timeout, a `GetTimeoutError` will be raised:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import workflow\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\n@workflow.step\ndef long_running_function():\n    time.sleep(8)\n    return \"Result\"\n\ntry:\n    result = long_running_function.run(timeout=4)\nexcept GetTimeoutError:\n    print(\"`get` timed out.\")\n```\n\nFor long-running jobs, you can submit them with the `--no-wait` flag and use other CLI commands to check on the job's status.\n\n```bash\n$ ray job submit --no-wait --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py\n```\n\nKeep in mind that the `timeout_s` parameter and `ray.get(timeout=...)` are for setting timeouts, while the `--no-wait` flag is for not waiting for the job to finish.",

It's also possible that there is a firewall setting preventing access to the GCS server.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can check the log directory /tmp/ray/session\\_latest/logs/ in the head Pod for errors related to the GCS server. You can also verify that the CLUSTER\\_DOMAIN environment variable is set correctly and that the ray executable is included in the $PATH for the image. If there are firewall settings preventing access to the GCS server, you may need to adjust them to allow traffic to the GCS server.\n\nIt's worth noting that if you have configured GCS fault tolerance on your cluster, your worker pod can continue serving traffic without restarting when the head pod crashes and recovers. Without GCS fault tolerance, KubeRay restarts all worker pods when the head pod crashes, so you'll need to wait for the workers to restart and the deployments to reinitialize before you can port-forward and send more requests.",

Specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices.\n4. Adjust the `local_fs_capacity_threshold` to prevent running out of disk space.\n5. In multi-node clusters, enable object spilling by specifying the `object_spilling_config` when starting the head node.\n\nEnabling object spilling can help you process datasets larger than cluster memory, but it may come with a performance penalty as data needs to be written to disk. Therefore, it's essential to use high-performance storage devices and configure spilling parameters appropriately to minimize the performance impact.",

Get the replica handle by using the `ray.get_actor()` function and the NAME of the replica from the output of the `ray list actors` command.\n2. Use the `ray.kill()` function along with the replica handle and `no_restart=True` argument to kill the replica.\n\nFor example, if you want to kill the replica with NAME \"SERVE\\_REPLICA::SleepyPid#PHvdJW\", you can use the following commands:\n```python\n>>> import ray\n>>> replica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#PHvdJW\", namespace=\"serve\")\n>>> ray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\nNote that this will kill the replica and prevent it from restarting.",

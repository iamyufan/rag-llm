The Ray autoscaler, which controls this process, is a component that runs on the head node of the Ray cluster. It increases or decreases the number of worker nodes in the cluster based on the resource demands of the Ray workload. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, but not to application metrics or physical resource utilization. It can be configured using the Ray cluster launcher or on Kubernetes. Autoscaling can reduce workload costs but adds node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure. It's important to note that the autoscaler considers logical resource requests for scaling, not physical machine utilization.",

However, this is not an ideal pattern for parallelism, as it prevents other tasks from running concurrently. Instead, you can use `asyncio.gather` to wait for multiple Ray tasks to complete concurrently.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while Ray integrates with `asyncio`, not all Ray constructs are compatible with `asyncio`. For example, you cannot use `asyncio` with remote tasks directly, but you can wrap them with a synchronous wrapper function.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `asyncio.gather` to wait for multiple Ray tasks to complete concurrently:\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\n\n# Wait for 4 tasks to complete concurrently\nawait asyncio.gather(*[actor.run_concurrent.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n```\nIn this example, we create an `AsyncActor` class with a `run_concurrent` method that performs some concurrent workload using `asyncio.sleep`. We then create an instance of this class and use a list comprehension to create 4 Ray tasks that call this method. Finally, we use `asyncio.gather` to wait for all 4 tasks to complete concurrently.",

            "answer": " Spark, Ray, and Dask are all distributed computing systems, each with their own strengths. Spark is a general-purpose cluster-computing system that provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs. It is widely used for data processing, ETL, machine learning, and graph processing tasks.\n\nRay is a high-performance distributed execution engine that can scale to thousands of nodes and supports a wide range of use cases, including machine learning, reinforcement learning, and general distributed computing tasks. Ray's core abstraction is the \"actor,\" which is an object that can be remote and can have state. Ray also provides a task-based API that allows users to parallelize and distribute computations.\n\nDask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing, built with the Python ecosystem in mind. It is designed to integrate with Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and provides advanced scheduling capabilities that allow it to scale to large clusters. Dask can be used to build custom workflows and can be integrated with Ray for a more seamless experience.\n\nRay Data handles many of the same batch processing workloads as Apache Spark, but with a streaming paradigm that is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference. Dask-on-Ray provides a Dask scheduler that runs on Ray, allowing Dask collections to be executed on a Ray cluster. Using Spark on Ray (RayDP) combines Spark and Ray clusters, making it easy to do large scale data processing using the PySpark API and use that data to train models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.",

However, the dashboard, dashboard agent, and GCS may take a few seconds to start up after the head pod is ready.\n\nIf you continue to encounter this issue after waiting for 1 minute, it's possible that the dashboard or dashboard agent may have failed to start. You can check the status of the Ray components by running `ray status` or checking the Ray logs.\n\nAdditionally, you can try setting the `RAY_ADDRESS` environment variable in the same format as the address parameter to connect to an existing cluster with `ray.init()` or `ray.init(address=\"auto\")`.\n\nIf you're testing on a remote cluster, make sure to specify the address of the Ray cluster to connect to with the `--address` argument when running `serve run`.

Write your LLM application as a single Python module, including all steps like prompt preprocessing, vector database lookups, LLM API calls, and response validation.\n2. Use the `@serve.deployment` decorator on a Python class (or function for simple use cases) to define a deployment.\n3. Bind the deployment with optional arguments to the constructor.\n4. Configure your deployment to scale out and assign replica resources such as CPUs and GPUs.\n5. Deploy your Ray Serve application to production on a Ray cluster using the Ray Serve CLI and a config file.\n\nFor production, it is recommended to run Ray Serve on Kubernetes using the KubeRay RayService custom resource for handling important production requirements.\n\nFor multiple Ray users, it's recommended to start a Ray cluster for each user to ensure workload isolation.",

You can then point TensorBoard to that directory to visualize the results.\n\nAdditionally, if you are running Ray on a remote multi-user cluster where you do not have sudo access, you can run the following commands to make sure TensorBoard is able to write to the `tmp` directory:\n```bash\nexport TMPDIR=/tmp/$USER; mkdir -p $TMPDIR; tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results\n```\nThis will ensure that TensorBoard has the necessary permissions to write to the `tmp` directory.",

When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n4. Killing a worker node can simulate a worker node failure, causing the actors running on it to fail. However, KubeRay attempts to restart the worker pod on another running node and bring up a new healthy node to replace it.\n\nAdditionally, nodes can die due to reasons such as low memory, as seen in the query's context.",

            "answer": " To programmatically set the target size of a Ray remote cluster immediately without scaling up through the autoscaler, you can control the number of worker nodes directly. Here's an example using `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import cluster_utils\n\n# Configure the head node and worker node resources\nhead_resources = {\"CPU\": 2}\nworker_resources = {\"CPU\": 4, \"object_store_memory\": 1024 * 1024 * 1024}\n\n# Set the number of worker nodes (replace 2 with your desired target size)\nnum_workers = 2\n\n# Create a custom node config for worker nodes\nworker_node_config = {\"min_workers\": num_workers, \"max_workers\": num_workers}\n\n# Create a Ray cluster with the specified configuration\ncluster = cluster_utils.Cluster(\n    head_resources=head_resources,\n    worker_resources=worker_resources,\n    worker_node_config=worker_node_config,\n)\n\n# Start the Ray cluster\ncluster.start()\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster\nray.init(address=cluster.address)\n```\n\nThis example creates a Ray cluster with a specified number of worker nodes (the target size) and connects to it. Note that this method bypasses the autoscaler and directly sets the target size. Make sure to replace `num_workers` with your desired target size.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach may not be ideal for all use cases, as it doesn't take into account resource demand or idle worker nodes. Autoscaling can help reduce workload costs and better manage resources, but it can add node launch overheads and may be tricky to configure. If you're new to Ray, it's recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters.",

Ensure that the `AsyncSampler` or `SyncSampler` classes, used for policy evaluation, are not causing any blocking or deadlocking issues.\n3. Inspect the configuration of your `RolloutWorker` instances, such as `env_creator`, `validate_env`, `config`, `worker_index`, `num_workers`, and `log_dir`. Make sure they are correctly set up.\n4. Utilize the `WorkerSet.foreach_worker_async` or `WorkerSet.foreach_worker` methods to apply a debugging function to each worker instance asynchronously or synchronously. This can help you identify any issues specific to individual workers.\n5. If you're using Ray actors for your rollout workers, ensure that there are no resource contention or allocation issues causing the deadlocks.\n6. Examine the `par_iter_slice_batch` method in the `RolloutWorker` class, which batches the parallel iteration slices. Make sure it's not causing any deadlocking issues.\n\nIf the issue persists, you can try reducing the complexity of your environment or policy and gradually increasing it to isolate the cause of the deadlock.

One way is to use the `ray.get(object_ref)` function, which blocks until the object corresponding to the object ref is available in the local object store. If the object is not in the local object store, it will be shipped from an object store that has it.\n\nAnother way is to use the `ray.put()` function, which returns an object ref that can be used to retrieve the object later.\n\nAdditionally, object refs can be returned by remote function calls. For example, if you have a remote function `my_func` that returns an object, you can get the object ref by calling `ref = my_func.remote()`.\n\nOnce you have an object ref, you can use it to retrieve the object by calling `ray.get(ref)`.",

If your function doesn't mutate its input, you can set `zero_copy_batch=True` when using `map_batches()` function. This will improve performance and decrease memory utilization as the batch will be a zero-copy, read-only view on data in Ray\u2019s object store.\n\nHere's an example:\n```python\nds = (ray.data.from_items([...])\n     .map_batches(add_dog_years, batch_format='numpy', zero_copy_batch=True))\n```\nIn this example, `add_dog_years` function doesn't mutate its input, so we can set `zero_copy_batch=True`.\n\nIf your function mutates its input, you cannot use zero-copy deserialization, and you should manually copy the array at the destination if you need to mutate it.",

Unique name: A named actor can be given a unique name within their namespace, which allows it to be retrieved from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Persistence: Named actors continue to exist as long as there is a handle to them, even if the creator's refcount drops to zero.\n3. Accessibility: Named actors can be accessed by other tasks or actors, even if the actor handle cannot be directly passed to them.\n4. Namespace specification: You can specify a namespace for a named actor while creating it, which allows for better organization and access control.\n\nNamed actors are useful when you need to maintain stateful workers or services that need to be accessed by other tasks or actors in the Ray cluster. However, if you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks.",

Note that if your episodes are typically shorter than 100 timesteps, the rollouts will still be the length of a single episode.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `complete_episodes` configuration parameter to specify that each rollout should only contain full episodes, never any episode fragments. This can be useful if you want to ensure that each rollout corresponds to a single, complete episode of your environment.\n\nHere is an example configuration that uses both `rollout_fragment_length` and `complete_episodes`:\n```\nconfig = {\n    \"rollout_fragment_length\": 100,\n    \"complete_episodes\": true,\n    # other configuration parameters...\n}\n```\nThis will ensure that each rollout is at most 100 timesteps long and contains a complete episode of your environment.

By default, this will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. If you want to force-exit the worker, you can pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel()`.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n```\nNote that currently, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled. If you want to cancel an actor task, you can also call `ray.cancel()` on the ObjectRef returned by the actor task. If you want to recursively cancel all child and actor tasks, you can pass `recursive=True` to `ray.cancel()`.\n\nCancelled tasks aren't retried and the `max_task_retries` option isn't respected. If you call `ray.get()` on a cancelled task, it will raise a `TaskCancelledError` if the task has been scheduled or interrupted. Only async actor tasks can be interrupted.\n\nIf you want to kill an actor forcefully, you can use the `ray.kill()` function. This will interrupt any running tasks on the actor, causing them to fail immediately. If you want to kill the actor but let pending tasks finish, you can call `actor.__ray_terminate__.remote()` instead to queue a termination task. Any atexit handlers installed in the actor will be run in this case. If the actor is a detached actor, subsequent calls to get its handle via `ray.get_actor()` will fail.",

            "answer": " The ValueError \"The actor ImplicitFunc is too large\" is likely due to a large array or object being implicitly captured in the actor's scope. To resolve this issue, you can use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store. Additionally, you may want to move the data loader to the training function and consider reducing the batch size to ensure full parallelization across the actor pool.\n\nIn your specific case, you can modify the `TorchPredictor` class to put the model in the Ray object store using `ray.put()` and then use the object reference in the `ActorPoolStrategy`. Here's an example:\n```python\nmodel = load_model()\nmodel_ref = ray.put(model)\n\nactors = [BatchPredictor.remote(model_ref) for _ in range(num_actors)]\npool = ActorPool(actors)\n\n# Use the ActorPoolStrategy with the model_ref\npredictions = ds.map_batches(\n    TorchPredictor,\n    num_gpus=1,\n    batch_size=1,\n    compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=2, object_store_memory=model_ref),\n)\n```\nNote that you may need to adjust the `object_store_memory` parameter to ensure that there is enough memory in the object store for the model. Additionally, you may want to consider autoscaling the actor pool by specifying `min_size` and `max_size` parameters in the `ActorPoolStrategy` constructor.",

In the context of Ray batch inference, this method is used to define the logic for processing a batch of data items, which are passed as an argument to the method. The `__call__()` method is part of a larger class that encapsulates the inference logic and any necessary state, such as the trained model. By defining this logic within a class and using the `__call__()` method, the inference process can be easily integrated with Ray Data's batch processing capabilities.",

Note that object references can only be used by the client from which they were obtained, so you will not be able to use any objects or actor references held by the server on behalf of the client after disconnecting. If the client disconnects unexpectedly, the client will attempt to reconnect to the server for a certain period of time before giving up. You can increase this time by setting the `RAY_CLIENT_RECONNECT_GRACE_PERIOD` environment variable.\n\nFor more information on using the Ray Client, you can refer to the following steps:\n\n1. Set up your Ray cluster.\n2. Install the Ray Client by running `pip install ray[client]`.\n3. Connect to the Ray Cluster with `ray.init(\"ray://<head_node_host>:10001>\")`.\n4.

Initialize the JobSubmissionClient with the local Ray cluster address and port (8265 by default):\n\n   ```python\n   from ray.job_submission import JobSubmissionClient\n   client = JobSubmissionClient(\"http://127.0.0.1:8265\")\n   ```\n\n4. Prepare the runtime environment, specifying the working directory containing the script:\n\n   ```python\n   runtime_env = {\"working_dir\": \"./\"}\n   ```\n\n5. Submit the job with the `submit_job` function:\n\n   ```python\n   job_id = client.submit_job(\n       entrypoint=\"python script.py\",\n       runtime_env=runtime_env,\n   )\n   print(job_id)\n   ```\n\n6. (Optional) Wait for the job to reach a specific status using the `wait_until_status` function:\n\n   ```python\n   def wait_until_status(job_id, status_to_wait_for, timeout_seconds=5):\n       # ... (function definition)\n\n   wait_until_status(job_id, [\"Succeeded\"])\n   ```\n\nFor remote clusters, replace `127.0.0.1` with the head node's IP address.\n\nTo submit the job using the Ray Jobs CLI, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nray job submit --working-dir your_working_directory -- python script.py\n```\n\nReplace `your_working_directory` with the path to the directory containing the script.",

Pass the variable as an argument to the actor's method instead of initializing it in `__init__`. This way, you can directly use `ray.put()` to pickle the variable before passing it to the actor's method.\n\n2. Alternatively, you can define a new method in the actor that returns the variable you want to pickle. Then, you can use `ray.get()` to get the unpickled value and `ray.put()` to pickle it.\n\nHere's an example of the second approach:\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self, global_var_actor):\n        self.global_var_actor = global_var_actor\n        self.my_variable = \"my_value\"  # the variable you want to pickle\n\n    def get_my_variable(self):\n        return self.my_variable\n\n    def f(self):\n        # get the unpickled value of my_variable\n        my_variable = ray.get(self.get_my_variable.remote())\n        # do something with my_variable\n        result = my_variable + 3\n        return result\n\nglobal_var_actor = GlobalVarActor.remote()\nactor = Actor.remote(global_var_actor)\n\n# pickle my_variable\nmy_variable_pickled = ray.put(ray.get(actor.get_my_variable.remote()))\n\n# use the pickled value\nresult = ray.get(actor.f.remote())\n```\nNote that each actor instance has its own copy of the class variables, so you cannot share class variables between different actor instances.",

Here is an example:\n\nFirst, define a class with a `__call__` method that performs the reduction operation:\n\n```python\nclass Reducer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.result = None\n\n    def __call__(self, batch):\n        # Perform reduction on batch and update self.result\n        pass\n```\n\nThen, create an `ActorPool` with your actors and call `map_batches` with your `Reducer`:\n\n```python\nactors = [RayActor.remote() for i in range(num_actors)]\nstrategy = ActorPoolStrategy(min_size=2, max_size=8)\n\nreducer = Reducer()\nds.map_batches(Reducer, batch_size=256, compute=strategy, fn_args=[reducer]).take()\n\nresult = reducer.result\n```\n\nIn this example, `Reducer` is called on each batch by each actor in parallel. The `fn_args` argument allows you to pass arguments to the `Reducer` constructor, so that each actor can access the same instance of `Reducer`. The `map_batches` function returns an iterator over the results of calling `Reducer.__call__` on each batch, which you can collect using the `take()` method. The final result of the reduction operation is stored in the `result` attribute of the `Reducer` instance.",

Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible.\n3. Create a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`.\n4. Be cautious when running tests in parallel.\n\nHere's an example of a test class with Ray initialization in Python:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_something(self):\n        # Your test code here\n        pass\n```\n\nIf you're working with Java, you can use the Ray Java API to initialize Ray and define actors.\n\nFor testing Ray Serve deployments, you can use RayServeHandle inside Ray.\n\nMake sure to use the `py_modules` field in the runtime environment when testing library development on Ray.\n\nFor more information, refer to the Ray documentation and tutorials provided in the context.",

For an in-depth guide on shuffle performance, see the Performance Tips and Tuning page.\n\nYou can also specify the shuffle implementation during program execution by setting the `RAY_DATA_SHUFFLE_IMPL` environment variable to `\"sort\"`, `\"hash\"`, or `\"push\"`. For example:\n```\n$ RAY_DATA_SHUFFLE_IMPL=push python my_script.py\n```\nThis will use the push-based shuffle implementation in `my_script.py`.",

When you call an async actor's method, it returns a future representing the operation's result. However, the driver program must call `ray.get()` on the IDs of the results to get the actual results, which blocks until the results are available. This can affect parallelism, so it's recommended to separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to remote functions, allowing them to run in parallel in the background.\n\nIn the context provided, an example of an async actor is given:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass AsyncActor:\n    async def run_concurrent(self):\n        print(\"started\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2) # concurrent workload here\n        print(\"finished\")\n```\n\nYou can call this async actor's method using the `.remote()` method and pass it to `ray.get()` to wait for the results:\n\n```python\nactor = AsyncActor.remote()\nray.get([actor.run_concurrent.remote() for _ in range(4)])\n```\n\nOr, you can use the `async_get()` function to wait for the results asynchronously:\n\n```python\nasync def async_get():\n    await actor.run_concurrent.remote()\n\nasyncio.run(async_get())\n```\n\nKeep in mind that only one task can be running at any point in time in async actors, and there will be only one thread in `AsyncActor`.",

If you call `ray.get()` in a loop, it can harm parallelism as the loop will not continue until the call to `ray.get()` is resolved. Instead, you can separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to remote functions, so all remote functions are spawned before waiting for the results and can run in parallel in the background.\n\nIn your specific case, the issue might be that you're not instantiating the recv side call, which can cause the `ray.get()` call to hang. To avoid this, ensure that you're correctly instantiating the recv side call for the function you're trying to execute remotely.\n\nAdditionally, avoid calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily for intermediate steps and only call it at the end to get the final result.

We then create a pipeline for generating text using the `pipeline` function from the `transformers` library.\n\nNext, we read text data from an S3 bucket using `ray.data.read_text`. We define a function `generate_text_from_prompts` that takes a batch of prompts and generates text from each prompt using the `generate_text` pipeline. We apply this function to the Dataset using `ds.map_batches`.\n\nFinally, we save the results to an S3 bucket using `ds_with_generated_text.write_text`. Note that you will need to replace `your-bucket-name` with the name of your S3 bucket.",

This will print the full runtime\\_env setup log messages to the driver (the script that calls `ray.init()`).\n\nYou can also use the Ray Debugger to debug your distributed applications by setting breakpoints in Ray tasks and actors and dropping into a PDB session to inspect variables, step within tasks or actors, and move up or down the stack. To use the Ray Debugger, you'll need to pass in the `--ray-debugger-external` flag to `ray start` when starting the cluster.\n\nThese options are all experimental and subject to change.

Here is an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\nreplica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")\nray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)\n```\nAlternatively, if you want to kill the actor immediately without waiting for it to complete any outstanding work, you can delete all actor handles that reference the actor. This will cause the actor to be terminated when the reference count goes to 0.\n```\ndel replica_handle\n```\nNote that if you have multiple references to the same actor handle, you will need to delete all of them in order to trigger actor deletion.\n\nFor more information, see the Python documentation on object deletion: <https://docs.python.org/3.9/reference/datamodel.html#object.__del__>\n\nIf you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call `ray.kill(actor)`. This will interrupt any running tasks on the actor and cause them to fail immediately.\n\nIf you want to terminate an actor forcefully from within one of the actor methods, you can use the `ray.actor.exit_actor()` function. This will kill the actor process and release resources associated with the actor.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def exit(self):\n        ray.actor.exit_actor()\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nactor.exit.remote()\n```\nThis approach should generally not be necessary as actors are automatically garbage collected. The ObjectRef resulting from the task can be waited on to wait for the actor to exit (calling `ray.get()` on it will raise a `RayActorError`).\n\nFor more information, see the Ray documentation on terminating actors: <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/terminating-actors.html>",

View the documentation on \"Debugging Out of Memory\" to learn how to troubleshoot out-of-memory issues.\n3. Find the tasks and actors that have high memory usage by viewing the per task and actor memory usage graph or using the CLI command `htop`.\n4. If you notice a memory leak on a Serve actor, use `memray` to debug. Set the env var `RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_MEMORY_PROFILING=1`, and run your Serve application.

For example, you can add `RayTrainReportCallback()` as shown in the code:\n```python\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n    callbacks=[RayTrainReportCallback()], # add callback here\n)\n```\nThe `RayTrainReportCallback` class is a pre-defined callback class that reports metrics and checkpoints to Ray Train. You can also create your own custom callback class by inheriting from `pl.Callback` and defining the necessary methods such as `on_train_begin`, `on_train_end`, `on_epoch_begin`, `on_epoch_end`, `on_batch_begin`, `on_batch_end`, `on_test_begin`, `on_test_end`, `on_save_checkpoint`, `on_load_checkpoint`, and `on_exception`.\n\nFor example, to create a custom callback class that prints the current batch number during training, you can define:\n```python\nclass PrintBatchCallback(pl.Callback):\n    def on_train_batch_end(self, trainer, pl_module, outputs, batch, batch_idx):\n        print(f\"Batch {batch_idx} completed\")\n```\nAnd then add it to the Trainer object as shown earlier:\n```python\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    model=model,\n    args=training_args,\n    train_dataset=small_train_ds,\n    eval_dataset=small_eval_ds,\n    compute_metrics=compute_metrics,\n    callbacks=[PrintBatchCallback()], # add custom callback here\n)\n```\nNote that some of the pre-defined callbacks, such as `RayTrainReportCallback`, may have specific requirements or dependencies, so be sure to read their documentation carefully.",

However, it's possible that the logs are being written to a different location or under a different logger name.\n\nTo modify the Ray logger, you can use the `logging` module in Python. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(\"ray\")\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # Set the logging level to debug\nlogger.info(\"This is an info message\")\nlogger.debug(\"This is a debug message\")\n```\nIf you're working with Ray applications, worker logs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while driver logs are captured only for Ray Jobs submitted via Jobs API. If you're running Ray Jobs by executing the Ray Driver on the Head node directly or connecting via Ray Client, you can view the Driver logs in your terminal or Jupyter Notebooks.\n\nIn your case, if you're unable to find the `log.info` messages in the Ray logs, you can try setting the logging level to `logging.DEBUG` to see if the messages are being written at a lower level.

This can happen if the dashboard port is not publicly exposed or if there is an issue with the internal refresh of the dashboard.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can try setting up port forwarding for the Ray dashboard port (8265 by default) when starting the Ray cluster on the head node. You can do this using the `--dashboard-port` argument when starting the cluster explicitly with the CLI, or passing the `dashboard_port` keyword argument in your call to `ray.init()` when starting the cluster implicitly.\n\nIf you are still having trouble viewing the dashboard after setting up port forwarding, you can try customizing the dashboard port to a different value to see if that resolves the issue. You can also check if the dashboard agent's default port (52365) is available and accessible from the head node.\n\nAdditionally, it is recommended to set up Prometheus and Grafana for critical features such as Metrics View when using the Ray Dashboard.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Ray documentation on Viewing Ray Dashboard in browsers, Changing the Ray Dashboard port, and Configuring and Managing Ray Dashboard.",

If you want to write to a file directly, you can use the `open()` function with the desired file path, relative to the trial directory.

To upload files or directories from your local machine to the worker nodes, you can use the `cluster_synced_files` configuration when initializing Ray. The same path on the head node will be copied to the worker node.\n4. If you need to access relative file paths in your Tune training function, you can use the original working directory as a reference and construct the desired file paths accordingly.\n\nRemember to avoid changing the working directory to the trial directory for read-only purposes, as it can lead to conflicts when multiple workers try to access the same location.

This allows you to access and update data from different parts of your application, even if they are running on different nodes.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` function to get the path to the trial directory, and use that as the working directory for your tasks and actors. This will ensure that all tasks and actors on the same node share the same working directory, and that the working directory is unique for each trial.\n\nNote that the current working directory of both functional and class trainables is set to the corresponding trial directory once it\u2019s been launched as a remote Ray actor. Therefore, you should use the trial directory as the path to save any outputs, and be careful not to accidentally write to the same location and overstep each other.\n\nYou can also disable the behavior of changing the working directory to the trial directory by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR` environment variable to `0`. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes, and you must make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use the object store to update a file in the working directory:\n```\n# Put the data in the object store\nray.put(\"hello.txt\", \"Hello, Ray!\")\n\n# Get the data from the object store and write it to a file\nwith open(\"hello.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(ray.get(\"hello.txt\"))\n```\nAnd here is an example of how you can use the trial directory as the working directory:\n```\n# Get the path to the trial directory\ntrial_dir = ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()\n\n# Use the trial directory as the working directory\nos.chdir(trial_dir)\n\n# Save the output to a file in the trial directory\nwith open(\"output.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"This is the output of the task.\")\n```",

It manages node membership and actor directory, and provides cluster-level operations like actor, placement groups, and node management. However, by default, GCS is not fault-tolerant, storing all data in-memory, and its failure leads to Ray cluster failure. To make GCS fault-tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\nYour GCS server might be taking up so much memory on the head node due to more than 1024 connections, which is common for the head node GCS process since many other components in Ray communicate with it. To handle this, you can adjust the max file descriptors limit per process via the ulimit command, like ulimit -n 65536 for the host configuration.\n\nAdditionally, the Ray head node has more memory-demanding system components like GCS or the dashboard, and the driver runs from a head node by default. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of tasks and actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems. In this case, do not run any tasks and actors on the head node by specifying --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node by ray start --head.\n\nTo tolerate head node failures, you need to make GCS fault-tolerant so that when you start a new head node, you still have all the cluster-level data.",

The KubeRay operator may keep restarting the RayCluster, leading to a loop of restarts. To debug this issue, you can check the Docker resource limits and Kubernetes logs for errors. You can also try running `ray up` with the `--restart-only` flag to restart the Ray cluster without running any installation commands. If your pods are stuck in the \"Pending\" state, you can check for errors using `kubectl describe pod` and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough. Additionally, you can check the Ray logs for any errors or warnings related to resource requests that cannot be scheduled.",

Also, the default batch format is fixed to NumPy. If you want to revert to legacy behavior temporarily, you can set the environment variable `RAY_DATA_STRICT_MODE=0` on all cluster processes.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the Ray cluster launcher to start a Ray cluster on AWS, and use any ML framework of your choice, including PyTorch, HuggingFace, or Tensorflow. Ray Data supports a wide variety of formats including CSV, Parquet, and raw images.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a Ray Dataset from a list of S3 links:\n```python\nimport pds\n\ns3_partitions = pds.dataset(\"s3://<your-bucket-name>/<your-file-path>\")\n```\nNote that Ray Data uses PyArrow dataset and table for reading or writing large parquet files, which is faster than pandas read\\_parquet.\n\nFinally, make sure that you have installed Ray Data by running `pip install -U \"ray[data]\"`.",

The `random_shuffle()` method shuffles the dataset in a map-reduce style, which can be slow and resource-intensive.\n\nIf you need to shuffle the data during iteration, you can use the `local_shuffle_buffer_size` parameter in the `iter_batches()` or `iter_torch_batches()` methods. This parameter allows you to shuffle a subset of rows up to a provided buffer size during iteration, which is more performant than a full global shuffle.\n\nHere's an example of how to use `iter_batches()` with `local_shuffle_buffer_size`:\n```python\nimport ray\n\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt\")\n\n# Shuffle data in blocks\nds = ds.randomize_block_order()\n\n# Iterate over batches with local shuffling\nfor batch in ds.iter_batches(local_shuffle_buffer_size=1000):\n    # Process batch\n    pass\n```\nIn this example, the `randomize_block_order()` method is used to randomize the order of data blocks, and the `iter_batches()` method is used to iterate over batches with local shuffling.

Use Ray logging to surface application-level details during runtime. Ray Serve uses Python's standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\", and logs are emitted both to stderr and on disk on each node. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program.\n4.

Refer to the RayService troubleshooting guide for tips on debugging issues with your Ray Serve scripts or Ray Serve configurations.\n\nAdditionally, you can configure fault tolerance in Ray by setting the `max_retries` and `retry_exceptions` options in `ray.remote()` and `.options()` to change the default behavior of retrying failed tasks due to system failures and specified application-level failures.",

First, forward the dashboard port to localhost using the command `kubectl port-forward svc/rayservice-sample-head-svc --address 0.0.0.0 8265:8265`. Then, check the Serve page in the Ray dashboard at `http://localhost:8265/#/serve`. Ray Serve will display exceptions in the 'Exceptions' tab of the application's page.\n\nIf you want to handle uncaught exceptions within your Ray Serve deployment, you can use a try-except block in your function handling the request. This way, you can log or handle the exception as needed.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass MyServeHandle(object):\n    def __call__(self, request):\n        try:\n            # Your request handling code here\n            ...\n        except Exception as e:\n            # Log or handle the exception here\n            ...\n```\n\nHowever, if you are looking for uncaught exceptions in the context of Ray's system or task errors, you can refer to the Ray documentation on exceptions, such as `RaySystemError`, `RayTaskError`, and `LocalRayletDiedError`. These exceptions can be caught and handled in your Ray application code as needed.",

In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, which is the Python script that calls `serve.run()` or the `serve run` CLI command.\n\nIf you are using Ray Jobs, worker logs are always captured in the Ray logging directory, while driver logs are only captured for Ray Jobs submitted via Jobs API. You can find the captured driver logs with the Dashboard UI, CLI, or Python SDK.\n\nAdditionally, you can enable runtime environment debugging log streaming by setting the environment variable `RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_LOG_TO_DRIVER_ENABLED=1` on each node before starting Ray. This will print the full runtime environment setup log messages to the driver.\n\nRay client logs can be found at `/tmp/ray/session_latest/logs` on the head node.\n\nIf you are using the Ray Dashboard, you can also view stack traces for active worker processes, actors, and job's driver process by clicking on the \"Stack Trace\" actions for those processes.",

Otherwise, you\u2019ll want to create a Ray cluster. To start a Ray cluster locally, you can run `ray start --head`. To start a Ray cluster remotely, you can follow the directions in Getting Started.\n2. Create a configuration file: You need to create a configuration file (e.g., `config.yaml`) that specifies the head node and worker nodes.

Ray automatically sets the CUDA\\_VISIBLE\\_DEVICES environment variable for GPU isolation, which most ML frameworks will respect for GPU assignment.\n\nYou can use the `@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)` decorator to specify the GPU resource requirements for tasks and actors. Here's an example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    print(\"ray.get_gpu_ids(): {}\".format(ray.get_gpu_ids()))\n    print(\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: {}\".format(os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"]))\n```\n\nTo limit the GPUs visible to Ray, you can set the CUDA\\_VISIBLE\\_DEVICES environment variable. For example:\n\n```bash\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,3 ray start --head --num-gpus=2\n```\n\nThis will let Ray only see devices 1 and 3. Note that Ray doesn't provide native integration with GPU profiling tools, so you should run GPU profilers like Pytorch Profiler without Ray to identify issues.",

Then, you can use the RayService controller provided as part of KubeRay to create a RayService custom resource, which encapsulates a multi-node Ray cluster and a Serve application into a single Kubernetes manifest. The RayService controller handles important production requirements such as health checking, status reporting, failure recovery, and upgrades. When deploying, it is recommended to provide more resources to the Serve application and configure the cluster for the networking characteristics of at least an r5dn.16xlarge on AWS EC2. You can use the example RayService CR as a starting point and customize it according to your needs.",

This could be because the GCS is not fault-tolerant and has failed, or because there is a problem with the health check itself.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can check the logs for the GCS server process in the head Pod for any errors. You can also check that the ray executable is included in the $PATH for the image and that the CLUSTER_DOMAIN environment variable is set correctly.\n\nIf the worker node cannot connect to the head node, you may see an error message like \"Unable to connect to GCS at xx.xx.xx.xx:nnnn.\" This could be caused by a problem with the IP address or firewall settings.\n\nIf the head node is inaccessible at the given address, you can use a tool like nmap or nc to check whether each port can be reached from a node.\n\nFinally, you can also try restarting the GCS server process or the entire Ray cluster to see if that resolves the issue.",

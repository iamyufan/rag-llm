To make sure TensorBoard is able to write to the tmp directory, you can set the `TMPDIR` environment variable to `/tmp/$USER`. Here's an example command to start TensorBoard:\n```bash\ntensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results --port 6006\n```\nYou can also customize the directory of results by specifying `air.RunConfig(storage_path=..)` in your Tuner.\n\nIf you are running Ray on a remote multi-user cluster where you do not have sudo access, you can use the following commands to forward the TensorBoard port and run TensorBoard:\n```bash\nray exec tune-default.yaml 'tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results/ --port 6006' --port-forward 6006\n```\nMake sure to replace `tune-default.yaml` with the appropriate configuration file for your Ray cluster.",

This will show you more information about the workers that were killed on the node due to memory pressure.\n\nAdditionally, you can monitor the memory usage of the worker nodes during training to identify which node is running out of memory. You can do this by checking the logs of the worker nodes and looking for messages that indicate memory pressure or OOM errors.\n\nTo reduce the likelihood of memory pressure or OOM errors, you can try reducing the batch size or the number of worker nodes.

Here's a simple example:\n```python\nimport ray\nray.init()\n\n# Put a value into the object store\nmy_obj = ray.put(\"Hello, Ray!\")\n\n# Get the value from the object store\nprint(ray.get(my_obj))\n```\nIn this example, we first initialize Ray using `ray.init()`.

Finally, we retrieve the object using `ray.get()` and print it.\n\nRegarding the query about the Ray Client, it is used to enable Ray applications to run on remote clusters. You can create a Ray cluster using a Ray Cluster Launcher, and then create a Ray client to connect to the cluster. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray import cluster_utils\n\n# Create a Ray cluster\ncluster = cluster_utils.create_ray_cluster(num_workers=2)\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster using the Ray client\nray.init(address=\"auto\")\n\n# Run your Ray application on the cluster\n# ...\n\n# Shutdown the Ray cluster\ncluster_utils.shutdown_ray_cluster(cluster)\n```\nIn this example, we create a Ray cluster using `cluster_utils.create_ray_cluster()`, and then connect to the cluster using `ray.init(address=\"auto\")`. After running your Ray application on the cluster, you can shut down the cluster using `cluster_utils.shutdown_ray_cluster()`.",

Here's an example of how you might use `torch` to do this:\n\nFirst, you would need to implement a class that defines the behavior of your actor, including the `__init__` and `__call__` methods.\n\nThen, you would create an `ActorPoolStrategy` and configure the number of concurrent workers. Each worker would transform a partition of data.\n\nNext, you would call `map_batches()` and pass your `ActorPoolStrategy` to compute.\n\nTo perform the all\\_reduce operation, you would need to get the data from each actor and then use `torch.distributed.all_reduce` to reduce the data across all the actors. Here's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom ray import worker\n\nclass MyActor(worker.Actor):\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n\n    def get_data(self):\n        return self.data\n\n# Create an ActorPoolStrategy and configure the number of concurrent workers\nstrategy = ray.util.actors.ActorPoolStrategy(num_workers=2)\n\n# Call map_batches() and pass your ActorPoolStrategy to compute\nactor_handles = [MyActor.remote() for _ in range(strategy.num_workers)]\ndata_list = ray.get([actor.get_data.remote() for actor in actor_handles])\n\n# Perform the all_reduce operation\ntensor_list = [t.to(\"cuda\") for t in data_list]\nreduced_tensor = torch.distributed.all_reduce(tensor_list)\n```\n\nNote that this is just an example, and you would need to modify it to fit your specific use case.

Here's a code snippet demonstrating this:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Enable push-based shuffle\nctx = ray.data.DataContext.get_current()\nctx.use_push_based_shuffle = True\n\n# Perform global shuffle\nds = (\n    ray.data.range(1000)\n    .random_shuffle()\n)\n```\n\nThis will shuffle the numbers from 0 to 999 in a globally random order.

Each actor will run in its own Python process.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define a custom module `my_module` with an actor class `MyActor`:\n```python\n# my_module.py\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = 0\n\n    def increment(self):\n        self.value += 1\n        return self.value\n\n    def get_counter(self):\n        return self.value\n```\nTo use this custom module with Ray, you can import it in your main script and create actors as follows:\n```python\n# main.py\nimport ray\nimport my_module\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Create an instance of MyActor\nmy_actor = my_module.MyActor.remote()\n\n# Call the increment method on the actor\nresult = ray.get(my_actor.increment.remote())\n\n# Print the result\nprint(result)\n```\nIn this example, `my_module` is a custom module that defines an actor class `MyActor`.

To get the ID of the head node, you can follow the steps mentioned in the context to obtain the head node's IP address and then extract the ID from it.\n\nHere's an example of how you can get the head node ID using `scontrol` command and then use `ray.util.state.get_node` to get the node state:\n```python\nimport subprocess\nimport ray\n\n# Get the head node IP address\nnodes = subprocess.check_output([\"scontrol\", \"show\", \"hostnames\", \"$SLURM_JOB_NODELIST\"]).decode().split()\nhead_node_ip = subprocess.check_output([\"srun\", \"--nodes=1\", \"--ntasks=1\", \"-w\", nodes[0], \"hostname\", \"--ip-address\"]).decode()\n\n# Get the head node ID from the IP address\nhead_node_id = head_node_ip.strip()\n\n# Get the head node state\nray_client = ray.util.state.get_node_client()\nhead_node_state = ray_client.get_node(head_node_id)\n\nprint(head_node_state)\n```\nNote that this example assumes that you are running it on the head node and that you have access to the `SLURM_JOB_NODELIST` environment variable. You may need to modify the commands accordingly if you are running them in a different context.",

You can start a Ray cluster locally by running `ray start --head`, or remotely by following the directions in the Ray documentation.\n2. Once your Ray cluster is running, you can use the Ray CLI to start a cluster. Run the following command:\n\n$ ray up -y config.yaml\n\nHere, `config.yaml` is a configuration file that specifies the settings for your Ray cluster, such as the number of nodes, the resources allocated to each node, and any additional arguments.\n\nBefore starting a cluster, you can also use the `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` utility to mock a multi-node Ray cluster in your application. This can be useful for testing and development purposes. For example:\n\nfrom ray.cluster_utils import Cluster\n\n# Starts a head-node for the cluster.\ncluster = Cluster(\ninitialize\\_head=True,\nhead\\_node\\_args={\n\"num\\_cpus\": 10,\n}\n)\n\nThis will start a head node for the cluster with 10 CPUs. You can then use the `cluster` object to interact with the cluster and execute Ray scripts. Note that this method is currently experimental and untested on Windows.

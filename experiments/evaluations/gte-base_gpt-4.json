You can configure the batch format to be either NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by specifying `batch_format` in `map_batches()`. If you're encountering issues with type conversions, make sure your function returns the correct format. For example, if you want to increase the brightness of an image batch represented as NumPy ndarrays, you can do:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness, batch_format=\"numpy\")\n)\n```\n\nAlso, remember that Ray Data represents batches as dicts of NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by default.

            "generated_answer": " Ray Serve's autoscaling feature automatically adjusts the number of replicas in a deployment based on its load. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node, increases or decreases the number of worker nodes based on the resource demands of the Ray workload. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. Autoscaling can be configured using the Ray cluster launcher or on Kubernetes. It's recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters if you're new to Ray, as autoscaling can reduce workload costs but adds node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler, requesting a number of replica actors based on demand. The autoscaler considers logical resource requests for scaling, not physical machine utilization. When using Ray with Kubernetes, the Ray Autoscaler and Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler complement each other.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Apache Spark is a mature and feature-rich framework for large-scale data processing, particularly excelling in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks and SQL queries. Dask is designed for parallel analytics and scientific computing workloads, providing big data collections that mimic NumPy and Pandas APIs, making it easier to scale up existing code. Ray is a high-performance distributed execution system, geared towards production, with a focus on general-purpose computing, including machine learning and AI workloads.\n\nDask can be integrated with Ray to leverage Ray's fast and fault-tolerant task execution system while using Dask's familiar APIs. This combination allows you to build data analyses using Dask's collections and execute them on a Ray cluster. However, Dask-on-Ray is not expected to achieve the same performance as using Ray directly.\n\nIn terms of batch processing workloads, Ray Data handles many of the same tasks as Apache Spark but with a streaming paradigm that is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference. For a more detailed performance comparison between Ray Data and Apache Spark, you can refer to the Offline Batch Inference: Comparing Ray, Apache Spark, and SageMaker document.\n\nRayDP (Spark on Ray) combines Spark and Ray clusters, making it easy to do large-scale data processing using the PySpark API and seamlessly use that data to train models using TensorFlow and PyTorch. This integration enables you to use Spark inside a Ray program, read input data, process data using SQL, Spark DataFrame, or Pandas (via Koalas) API, extract and transform features using Spark MLLib, and use RayDP Estimator API for distributed training on the preprocessed dataset.\n\nIn summary, Spark, Ray, and Dask each have their unique features and use cases. Dask can be integrated with Ray for a more user-friendly API, while Ray Data provides a streaming paradigm for deep learning inference tasks. RayDP enables the use of Spark and Ray together for large-scale data processing and model training.",

If a node is overloaded with more tasks than its resources allow, it may be because the tasks or actors are using more than their proportionate share of memory. To avoid this, you can specify resource requirements for tasks or actors, such as memory or CPUs, to limit the number of concurrently running tasks on a given node. This can be done in C++ using the `SetResource` method. Ray's resources are logical, meaning that the resource requirements of tasks or actors do not impose limits on actual physical resource usage. It's your responsibility to make sure tasks or actors use no more resources than specified via resource requirements.",

To tolerate head node failures, we need to make GCS fault-tolerant so that when we start a new head node, we still have all the cluster-level data.\n3.

Inconsistent configurations might lead to deadlocks.\n2. **Implement logging and debugging information**: Add print statements or use a logging library to print information about the state of the workers, policies, and environments during rollouts. This can help you identify which part of the code is causing the deadlock.\n3. **Use Ray's built-in tools for debugging**: Ray provides several tools for debugging, such as the Ray dashboard for visualizing the cluster and worker states. You can also use `ray.get_object_info(worker.local_worker.pid)` to get information about a specific worker's process.\n4. **Inspect the Ray dashboard**: The Ray dashboard can provide valuable insights into the state of the Ray cluster, including worker and task execution. Monitor the dashboard to see if there are any issues with task execution or worker states.\n5. **Check for resource contention**: Deadlocks can occur due to resource contention. Ensure that there are no other resource-intensive tasks running on the same Ray cluster that might interfere with the RLlib workers.\n6. **Implement timeouts**: Implement timeouts for worker tasks to prevent them from running indefinitely. This can help you identify which tasks are taking too long to complete and potentially causing deadlocks.\n7. **Use WorkerSet.foreach_worker and WorkerSet.foreach_worker_async**: These methods allow you to iterate over all workers and call a function with each worker as an argument. You can use these methods to debug worker states and identify any issues.\n8. **Check the Ray logs**: Ray generates logs that can help you identify issues with the cluster or worker execution. Check the Ray logs for any error messages or warnings related to the deadlock.\n9. **Simplify your setup**: If you are still unable to identify the cause of the deadlock, try simplifying your setup by reducing the number of workers, environments, or policies. This can help you isolate the issue and identify the root cause.\n10. **Check the implementation of par_iter_slice_batch**: Ensure that the implementation of `par_iter_slice_batch` in the `RolloutWorker` class is correct and not causing any deadlocks.\n\nRemember to use Ray's synchronous, single-threaded actor behavior to your advantage when debugging.

Here's an example:\n```python\ndataset1 = ...  # your first dataset\ndataset2 = ...  # your second dataset\n\n# Join the datasets using the union function\ndataset_joined = dataset1.union(dataset2)\n```\nThe `union` function concatenates the datasets row-wise, preserving the order of the blocks and the relative ordering between the datasets. Note that this operation will trigger execution of any lazy transformations performed on the dataset.\n\nKeep in mind that this method does not perform a SQL-like join (e.g., inner join, left join, etc.) but simply concatenates the datasets. If you need to perform a SQL-like join, you would need to filter and transform the datasets accordingly.",
            "reference_answer": "To join two ray datasets, you can use the `zip` method provided by the `ray.data.Dataset` API. This method materializes and zips the columns of one dataset with the columns of another. The datasets must have the same number of rows. Their column sets are merged, and any duplicate column names are disambiguated with suffixes like '_1'. The smaller of the two datasets is repartitioned to align the number of rows per block with the larger dataset. Here is an example: \\n\\n>>> import ray\\n>>> ds1 = ray.data.range(5)\\n>>> ds2 = ray.data.range(5)\\n>>> ds1.zip(ds2).take_batch()\\n{'id': array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]), 'id_1': array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])}",

If the function needs to modify the data, manually copy the array at the destination. When using `map_batches()` with numpy arrays, set `zero_copy_batch=True` to improve performance and decrease memory utilization. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nds = ray.data.from_numpy(np.ones((1, 100)))\n\ndef add_dog_years(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"age_in_dog_years\"] = 7 * batch[\"age\"]\n    return batch\n\nds = ds.map_batches(add_dog_years, batch_format=\"numpy\", zero_copy_batch=True)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `add_dog_years` function doesn't mutate the input numpy arrays, so you can safely set `zero_copy_batch=True`. If your function needs to modify the input arrays, you should manually copy the array at the destination before mutating it.",

Fault tolerance: Ray handles actor fault tolerance in case of actor process death or owner death.\n4. Useful for synchronization: Actors can be used to synchronize other tasks and actors when multiple tasks need to wait on some condition or synchronize across tasks and actors on a cluster.\n\nDisadvantages of using a singleton Actor in Ray:\n\n1. Overhead for simple tasks: If you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks, as actors come with additional overhead.\n2. Global state management: Using class variables to manage state between instances of the same class is not supported, as each actor instance is instantiated in its own process.\n3. Performance issues with closures: Closure capturing large objects can harm performance.\n4. Anti-pattern with global variables: Using global variables to share state between tasks and actors is considered an anti-pattern. Instead, encapsulate the global variables in an actor and pass the actor handle to other tasks and actors.\n\nIn summary, using a singleton Actor in Ray can be beneficial for stateful services, resource management, and synchronization across tasks and actors.

To resolve this issue, you can use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store and then pass them by object ID to the actor. Additionally, you may want to consider reducing the size of the actor or increasing the amount of object store memory available to Ray.\n\nIn the context provided, it is recommended to move the data loader to the training function and to use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store. It is also suggested to use an autoscaling actor pool for the inference stage and to set the `max_tasks_in_flight_per_actor` to 2 or greater to increase opportunities for pipelining task dependency prefetching with computation and avoid actor startup delays.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code to use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store:\n\n```python\n# Put the large object in the Ray object store\nlarge_object = ray.put(large_object)\n\n# Pass the object ID to the actor\npredictions = ds.map_batches(\n    TorchPredictor,\n    num_gpus=1,\n    batch_size=1,\n    compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=2),\n    args=(large_object,)\n)\n```\n\nIn the `TorchPredictor` class, you can then retrieve the large object from the object store using `ray.get()`:\n\n```python\nclass TorchPredictor:\n\n    def __init__(self, object_id):\n        self.large_object = ray.get(object_id)\n\n    def __call__(self, batch):\n        # Use the large object in the computation\n        # ...\n```\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider increasing the amount of object store memory available to Ray by adjusting the `object_store_memory` configuration parameter. For example, to set the object store memory to 20 GB, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nray start --object-store-memory=20GB\n```\n\nI hope this helps!

Note that object references can only be used by the client from which they were obtained, so you will not be able to use any objects or actor references held by the server on behalf of the client after disconnecting. If the client disconnects unexpectedly, the client will attempt to reconnect to the server for a certain period of time before giving up.

First, create a list of actors.\n2. Then, create a collective group using `ray.util.collective.create_collective_group`.\n3. Perform the all\\_reduce operation using `ray.util.collective.allreduce`.\n\nHere's some example code:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.collective import allreduce, create_collective_group\n\n# Create a list of actors\nactors = [BatchPredictor.remote(model_ref) for _ in range(num_actors)]\n\n# Create a collective group\ngroup = create_collective_group(actors, world_size=num_actors, ranks=list(range(num_actors)), backend='nccl', group_name='default')\n\n# Perform the all_reduce operation\nresult = allreduce(input_data, op=ray.util.collective.ReduceOp.SUM, group=group)\n```\n\nIn this example, `input_data` is the data you want to perform the all\\_reduce operation on. The `op` parameter specifies the reduction operation (in this case, summation). The `group` parameter specifies the collective group to use for the operation. The result of the all\\_reduce operation will be stored in the `result` variable.",

This function takes in the results from each actor, and reduces them into a single output by adding up all word occurrences. The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible.\n3. Create a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`.\n4. Be careful when running tests in parallel.\n\nHere's an example of how to set up a test case with a shared Ray cluster:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_my_function(self):\n        # Your test code here\n        pass\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n```\n\nMake sure to call `ray.shutdown()` in the `tearDown` method to release resources after each test.\n\nIf you're working with Java and Ray, you can use TestNG for testing:\n\n```java\nimport io.ray.api.ObjectRef;\nimport io.ray.api.Ray;\nimport org.testng.Assert;\n\npublic class RayTest {\n\n    @BeforeClass\n    public static void setup() {\n        Ray.init();\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    public void testMyFunction() {\n        // Your test code here\n        Assert.assertEquals(myFunction(), expectedResult);\n    }\n\n    @AfterClass\n    public static void teardown() {\n        Ray.shutdown();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn both examples, make sure to shut down Ray after your tests to release resources and avoid conflicts between tests.",
            "reference_answer": "To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the unittest module in Python. You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

To integrate with asyncio, Ray provides the `asyncio.run(async_get())` function to run the event loop and process the results asynchronously.

            "generated_answer": " To debug a hanging `ray.get()` call, there are a few things to consider. First, `ray.get()` is a blocking call, which means it waits until the requested result is available. If you call `ray.get()` in a loop, the loop will not continue to run until the call to `ray.get()` is resolved. This can harm parallelism, as you wait for the previous function call to finish before spawning the next call in the next iteration of the loop.\n\nTo avoid this, you can separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This way, all remote functions are spawned before you wait for the results, allowing them to run in parallel in the background. Additionally, you can pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` instead of calling it one by one to wait for all of the tasks to finish.\n\nAnother anti-pattern to avoid is calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily for intermediate steps. If you don't need to manipulate the object, you probably don't need to call `ray.get()` on it. It's best practice to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get()`, or even design your program to avoid having to call `ray.get()` at all.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you can use Ray's built-in debugger to set breakpoints in your Ray tasks and actors and inspect variables in that context, step within that task or actor, move up or down the stack, and more. However, keep in mind that the Ray Debugger is an experimental feature and is currently unstable.",
            "reference_answer": "To debug a hanging `ray.get()` call, you can use the Ray dashboard to view stack traces by clicking on the 'Stack Trace' actions for active worker processes, actors, and job\u2019s driver process.

The autoscaler will add worker nodes as needed, up to a maximum of 10 nodes.\n\nIf you want to launch a Ray cluster on a cloud platform like GCP or AWS, you can use the built-in support for launching cloud clusters in Ray. The configuration for these clusters can be set up in a YAML file, as described in the Ray documentation. However, this approach will still set the minimum number of workers to 0. If you want to set the minimum number of workers to a value other than 0, you can modify the `min_workers` parameter in the YAML file.",

            "generated_answer": " To update files in the working directory, you can use the `with open(filepath, \"w\")` context manager to write to a file, where `filepath` is a string specifying the path to the file. When using Tune, the current working directory of the trainable is set to the corresponding trial directory, so you can use relative paths to write to files. If you need to write to a specific directory, you can use the `to_directory([path])` function to write checkpoint data to the specified directory. Additionally, if you're running Ray on multiple machines, you'll need to make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes.\n\nHere's an example of how you can write to a file in the current working directory:\n```\nwith open(\"./artifact.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"Artifact Data\")\n```\nAnd here's an example of how you can write to a specific directory:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.put(\"some_data\", to_directory=\"/path/to/directory\")\n```\nYou can also use the `to_directory` function to write checkpoint data to a specific directory.\n```\nray.train.checkpoint.save_checkpoint(checkpoint_path=\"/path/to/directory\", ...)\n```\nIt's important to note that the working directory is shared between workers, so you should use the `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` API to get the path for saving trial-specific outputs.\n\nAlso, you can use `cluster_synced_files` and `file_mounts` to sync files and directories from the head node to the worker nodes.\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"cluster_synced_files\": [\"/path/to/file\"]})\n```\nYou can also use `file_mounts` to mount a directory from the head node to the worker nodes.\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"file_mounts\": [(\"/path/to/directory\", \"/mount/path\")]})\n```\nYou can also use `rsync_exclude` to exclude certain files or directories when syncing or mounting.\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"file_mounts\": [(\"/path/to/directory\", \"/mount/path\")], \"rsync_exclude\": [\"**/.git\"]})\n```\nYou can also disable the behavior of changing the working directory by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR=0` environment variable. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes, and you must make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.",

It stores data in-memory, which means that its failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail. To make the GCS fault-tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\nThe head node has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard, which can cause out-of-memory problems if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of tasks and actors from a head node.\n\nThe GCS server can take up a lot of memory on the head node due to the many network connections it creates.

Standalone Python objects are no longer supported.\n* The default batch format is fixed to NumPy. To revert to legacy behavior temporarily, set the environment variable `RAY_DATA_STRICT_MODE=0` on all cluster processes.\n\nRay Data supports various cloud storage services like S3, and it can read from any filesystem supported by Arrow. It also supports a wide variety of data formats including CSV, Parquet, and raw images.\n\nTo learn more about creating datasets, you can refer to the [Ray Data User Guide](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/user-guide.html).\n\nKeep in mind that this example assumes you have already set up a Ray cluster on AWS.

This can cause the Ray Data job to hang. To ensure that there are always available CPUs for Ray Data execution, you can limit the number of concurrent Tune trials with the max\\_concurrent\\_trials Tune option. Additionally, network communication overhead in Ray Tune on a distributed setup can also lead to a slowdown in performance.",
            "reference_answer": "Your Ray tuner might be showing 'running' but CPU usage is almost 0% due to several reasons. It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

            "generated_answer": " To make the GPU available on your M1 laptop for Ray, you need to ensure that Ray is installed correctly on your M1 Mac. Ray officially supports Apple silicon (M1) hardware. Here are the steps to install Ray on your M1 Mac:\n\n1. Install miniforge by running the following commands in your terminal:\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh\nbash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh\nrm Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh # Cleanup.\n```\n2. Ensure you're using the miniforge environment by activating it in your terminal:\n```bash\nsource ~/.bash_profile\nconda activate\n```\n3. Install Ray as you normally would by running the following command:\n```\npip install ray\n```\n\nOnce Ray is installed, you can use the `num_gpus` parameter in the `@ray.remote` decorator to specify the number of GPUs required for a particular task. For example, the following code specifies that the `use_gpu` function requires 1 GPU:\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    print(\"ray.get_gpu_ids(): {}\".format(ray.get_gpu_ids()))\n    print(\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: {}\".format(os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"]))\n```\nNote that Ray automatically sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to make the specified GPUs visible to Ray. If you want to limit the GPUs that are visible to Ray, you can use the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to specify the GPUs that Ray should see. For example, the following command starts Ray and limits it to using GPUs 1 and 3:\n```bash\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,3 ray start --head --num-gpus=2\n```\nHowever, it's important to note that Ray does not automatically handle GPU sharing or memory management for multiple trials. If you want to use multiple GPUs per trial, you should check out LightningTrainer. Additionally, Ray does not provide native integration with GPU profiling tools.

For example, if you're running a Horovod job with Ray, you can set the `HorovodConfig.timeout_s` field to specify the timeout in seconds.\n\nHere's an example of how to set a timeout for a Horovod job:\n```python\nfrom ray.train.horovod import HorovodConfig\n\nHorovodConfig.timeout_s = 300  # Set timeout to 300 seconds\n```\nAlternatively, you can set a timeout for a specific `get` call to wait for a result from a remote function. You can do this by wrapping the `get` call in a try-except block and catching the `GetTimeoutError` exception.\n\nHere's an example of how to set a timeout for a `get` call:\n```python\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\n@ray.remote\ndef long_running_function():\n    time.sleep(8)\n\nobj_ref = long_running_function.remote()\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)\nexcept GetTimeoutError:\n    print(\"`get` timed out.\")\n```\nIn this example, the `get` call will timeout after 4 seconds and raise a `GetTimeoutError` exception.

This option allows you to specify a local disk path where the ray temporary data will be stored. The cluster will create a subdirectory beneath this path for the temporary files of the cluster.\n\nFor example, if you want to set the temporary directory to `/custom/tmp`, you can start the cluster with the following command:\n\n```\nray start --head --ray-temp-root-dir=/custom/tmp\n```\n\nThis will create a subdirectory called `ray-<head_port>-<random_suffix>` beneath `/custom/tmp` where the temporary files for the cluster will be stored.\n\nNote that this option only works when the `--head` flag is specified, and it is currently not possible to set a local directory per-task or per-actor. If the local directory contains a `.gitignore` file, the files and paths specified there will not be uploaded to the cluster. You can disable this by setting the environment variable `RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_IGNORE_GITIGNORE=1` on the machine doing the uploading.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

There are two types of smoothing factors: `upscale_smoothing_factor` and `downscale_smoothing_factor`. The `upscale_smoothing_factor` can be increased to scale up resources quickly when there is high traffic volume in a short period of time.

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM.

            "generated_answer": " The error message you're seeing, \"Health check failed for node,\" is likely related to the Global Control Service (GCS) in Ray. The GCS is a critical component of Ray that manages cluster-level metadata and provides node management. If the GCS fails, then functions like actor creation, deletion, and resource management will not be available.\n\nTo make the GCS fault tolerant, you need to use HA Redis. This will allow the GCS to recover and resume regular functions when it restarts. During the recovery period, some functions will not be available, but the node should still be up and running.\n\nBased on the context provided, some possible causes for this error include:\n\n* The GCS server process has failed in the head Pod. You can check the log directory /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/ in the head Pod for errors related to the GCS server.\n* The ray executable is not included in the $PATH for the image, so the init container will fail to run ray health-check.\n* The CLUSTER_DOMAIN environment variable is not set correctly.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the GCS server logs for any errors.\n2. Verify that the ray executable is included in the $PATH for the image.\n3. Check that the CLUSTER_DOMAIN environment variable is set correctly.\n4. If you are using HA Redis, make sure it is properly configured and running.\n5. If the issue persists, you may need to restart the Ray cluster or the affected node.",
            "reference_answer": "The error message you're seeing is from the GCS server, which manages Ray cluster metadata. This error typically indicates that the health check for a particular node in your Ray cluster has failed. However, if the node is still up and running, it could be a temporary network issue or a bug in the health check itself.

Configure the directory where objects are spilled to by setting the \"directory\\_path\" parameter in the \"object\\_spilling\\_config\" when initializing Ray.\n3. Specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices.\n4. Adjust the threshold for local object spilling by setting the \"local\\_fs\\_capacity\\_threshold\" parameter.\n5. Use a large buffer size (> 1MB) for spilling to reduce IO requests, especially when using an HDD.\n6. Enable more IO workers for remote storage or parallelism by setting the \"max\\_io\\_workers\" parameter.\n7. Optimize performance by using an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads.\n\nNote that object spilling is useful for out-of-core data processing for memory-intensive distributed applications, but it comes with a performance penalty since data needs to be written to disk.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It is the foundation of Ray's AI libraries and third-party integrations, and can run on various environments including laptops, clusters, clouds, and Kubernetes. Ray Workflows is built on top of Ray Core and offers a mostly consistent subset of its API while providing durability. Ray Core can be used for custom applications, and it has a growing ecosystem of community integrations.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",

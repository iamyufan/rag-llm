            "generated_answer": " Ray Serve's autoscaling feature automatically adjusts the number of replicas in a deployment based on its load. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node, increases or decreases the number of worker nodes based on the resource demands of tasks, actors, or placement groups. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, the Ray autoscaler will remove nodes with no Ray actors or tasks running on them. The autoscaler uses logical resources expressed in task and actor annotations, not physical usage metrics like CPU and memory. Autoscaling can reduce workload costs but adds node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

            "generated_answer": " Spark, Ray, and Dask are all distributed computing systems, but they have different focuses and use cases.\n\nApache Spark is a general-purpose cluster-computing system that provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and can handle batch processing and stream processing of large datasets. It's widely used in data engineering and data science tasks.\n\nRay is a high-performance distributed execution engine that can scale up to large clusters, and it's designed to support a wide range of applications, including machine learning, reinforcement learning, and large-scale data processing. Ray's unique feature is its ability to support actor-based programming, which makes it a good choice for applications that require low-latency and high-throughput.\n\nDask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing, built with the Python ecosystem in mind. It's designed to integrate well with existing Python libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, and it can be used to scale up these libraries to large datasets and distributed environments. Dask can be used with Ray as a scheduler, which allows you to build data analyses using Dask's collections and execute them on a fast, fault-tolerant distributed task execution system geared towards production.\n\nIn summary, Spark is a general-purpose data processing system, Ray is a high-performance distributed execution engine, and Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing in Python. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your use case.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Data, Spark, and Dask are all used for data processing but they have different strengths. Ray Data is designed for offline batch jobs and abstracts away infrastructure management, sharding of datasets, parallelization of inference over shards, and data transfer from storage to CPU to GPU. It is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference. Apache Spark is a distributed data processing framework that can handle batch processing workloads but Ray Data uses a streaming paradigm that is more suited for these tasks. Dask was not mentioned in the context provided.",

It is not tied to any specific machine learning framework, allowing for flexibility in using new libraries and model architectures.\n\nUsing containers for model serving can be an alternative, but Ray Serve offers features like model composition, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, and dynamic request batching, which can be beneficial for large language models and complex inference services.\n\nIn summary, Ray Serve is a good choice for model serving when you need scalability, model composition, and flexibility with your machine learning frameworks, but it may not provide the same level of model management and visualization features as other full-fledged ML platforms like Seldon.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Serve is a scalable model serving library that is framework-agnostic, meaning it can serve everything from deep learning models built with frameworks like PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Keras, to Scikit-Learn models, to arbitrary Python business logic. It has several features and performance optimizations for serving Large Language Models such as response streaming, dynamic request batching, multi-node/multi-GPU serving, etc. Ray Serve is particularly well suited for model composition and many model serving, enabling you to build a complex inference service consisting of multiple ML models and business logic all in Python code. It is built on top of Ray, so it easily scales to many machines and offers flexible scheduling support such as fractional GPUs so you can share resources and serve many machine learning models at low cost. While containers can be used for deployment, Ray Serve provides a more comprehensive and flexible solution specifically designed for machine learning models.",

The `sync_timeout` is set to 1800 seconds, which is the maximum time to wait for synchronization before timing out. The `sync_artifacts` is set to `False`, which means that synchronization of artifacts is disabled. The `sync_artifacts_on_checkpoint` is set to `True`, which means that artifacts will be synchronized when a checkpoint is saved. The `sync_on_checkpoint` is set to `False`, which means that synchronization will not happen when a checkpoint is saved.\n\nYou can then use the `run_config` object in your Ray AIR job.

            "generated_answer": " Based on the information provided, it seems like you are experiencing a deadlock issue when using ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout\\_worker.py. To debug this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Disable the memory monitor by setting the environment variable RAY\\_memory\\_monitor\\_refresh\\_ms to zero when Ray starts. This can help you determine if the memory monitor is causing the deadlock.\n2. Check if there are any available CPUs in the Ray cluster. If not, you may need to free up resources by stopping any unnecessary actors or Tune trials.\n3. Use the Ray profiling tools to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues. You can use the `ray memory` command to observe memory usage and the `ray perf-dashboard` command to visualize performance metrics.\n4. Check the configuration of your RolloutWorker, including the `env_creator`, `validate_env`, `config`, `worker_index`, `num_workers`, `recreated_worker`, `log_dir`, `spaces`, `default_policy_class`, and `dataset_shards` parameters. Make sure they are configured correctly and not causing any conflicts.\n5. Use the `RayTrainWorker` logs to identify any warning messages or errors that may be related to the deadlock.\n6. If none of the above steps help, you can try adding logging statements to the `RolloutWorker` class to debug the issue further. You can use the `logging` module to print out debug information at various points in the code and see where the deadlock is occurring.\n7. You can also refer to the Ray Tune FAQ and the Ray documentation for more information on how to debug common issues with Ray and RLlib.",

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support.

This function takes in two parameters: `metric` and `mode`. The `metric` parameter is the key for checkpoints to order on, and the `mode` parameter is one of [\"min\", \"max\"]. The function returns a Checkpoint object, or None if there is no valid checkpoint associated with the metric.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this function:\n```\nbest_checkpoint = get_best_checkpoint(metric=\"your_metric\", mode=\"max\")\n```\nThis will return the checkpoint with the highest value for the specified metric. If you want to find the checkpoint with the lowest value for the metric, you can use \"min\" as the value for the `mode` parameter.\n\nIt is important to note that any checkpoints without an associated metric value will be filtered out. Therefore, you need to make sure that all checkpoints have a metric value associated with them.\n\nYou can also use the `get_best_checkpoint` method of the `ExperimentAnalysis` class to get the best checkpoint of an experiment. This method returns the checkpoint path of the best trial of the experiment, where the best trial is determined by comparing the last trial results using the metric and mode parameters passed to `tune.run()`.\n\nHere is an example of how you can use this method:\n```\nbest_checkpoint = ray.tune.ExperimentAnalysis.best_checkpoint\n```\nThis will return the best checkpoint of the experiment.\n\nI hope this helps!

This can be useful for handling a series of related operations that require shared state.\n\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to using a singleton actor. One of the main disadvantages is that it can limit scalability, as there is only a single instance of the actor that can handle requests. This can become a bottleneck if there are a large number of requests that need to be processed concurrently.\n\nAnother disadvantage is that if the stateful part of an actor is not needed, it may be more appropriate to use tasks instead. Class variables are not shared between actor instances, as each actor instance is instantiated in its own process and has its own copy of class variables. Therefore, if the stateful part of an actor is not needed, using tasks can be a more efficient and scalable option.",

            "generated_answer": " In RLlib, you can set a maximum episode length by using the `evaluation_duration` parameter in your configuration. This parameter determines the number of episodes that will be run during evaluation. However, it's important to note that this parameter controls the maximum number of episodes, not the maximum length of a single episode.\n\nIf you want to limit the length of individual episodes during training, you can do so by implementing a custom environment that has a method to reset the environment when the episode length exceeds a certain limit. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n```python\nclass MyEnv(gym.Env):\n    def __init__(self, max_episode_length=100):\n        self.max_episode_length = max_episode_length\n\n    def step(self, action):\n        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = super().step(action)\n        if terminated or truncated or self.step_count >= self.max_episode_length:\n            self.reset()\n        self.step_count += 1\n        return obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info\n\n    def reset(self):\n        super().reset()\n        self.step_count = 0\n```\nIn this example, the `step` method checks if the episode length has exceeded the maximum limit (`max_episode_length`) after each step. If it has, the environment is reset. You can adjust the `max_episode_length` parameter to set the desired maximum episode length.",

For example, to read a gzipped text file, you can do:\n```python\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://your-bucket-name/path/to/your/text-file.txt.gz\",\n                        arrow_open_stream_args={\"compression\": \"gzip\"})\n```\nIf you want to read multiple text files from a directory in S3, you can pass a wildcard pattern to the `read_text` function. For example, to read all text files in a directory, you can do:\n```python\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://your-bucket-name/path/to/your/directory/*.txt\")\n```\nThis will read all text files with the `.txt` extension in the specified directory.",

This function returns the current actor ID in hex format as an optional string. Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray.runtime_context import RuntimeContext\n\ncurrent_actor_id = RuntimeContext.get_actor_id()\nprint(current_actor_id)\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the `actor_id` property from the `ray.runtime_context.RuntimeContext` class, which has the same behavior as the `get_actor_id()` function.\n\nNote that these APIs are deprecated and may be removed in future Ray releases. It is recommended to use the `get_actor()` function from the `ray.util.state` module instead, which returns the state of an actor by its ID.\n\nYou can also use the `ray get actors` command to get the state of a single actor by its ID. For example:\n```\nray get actors <actor-id>\n```\nThis will print the state of the actor with the given ID in the format of an `ActorState` dictionary.\n\nTo get the logs of an actor, you can use the `ray logs actor` command with the `--id` option. For example:\n```\nray logs actor --id <actor-id>\n```\nThis will print the logs of the actor with the given ID.\n\nYou can also use the `get_log()` function from the `ray.util.state` module to get the logs of an actor programmatically. For example:\n```\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\nfor line in get_log(actor_id=<actor-id>):\n    print(line)\n```\nThis will print the logs of the actor with the given ID one line at a time.\n\nNote that the `get_log()` function returns an iterator, so you can use it to process the logs in a loop or to get a specific number of lines from the logs using the `islice()` function from the `itertools` module.\n\nFor more information about the `ray.util.state` module and the `ray logs` command, you can refer to the Ray documentation.",

            "generated_answer": " To use `ray.put` and `ray.get`, you need to understand that `ray.put` is used to store an object in the Ray object store and returns an object reference (ID). This ID can be used to pass the object as an argument to any remote function or method call. On the other hand, `ray.get` is used to return an object or list of objects from the object ID or list of object IDs. It is a synchronous (i.e., blocking) operation.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Put an object in the object store\nobject_id = ray.put(\"Hello, Ray!\")\n\n# Get the object from the object store\nobject_ref = ray.get(object_id)\n\n# Print the object\nprint(object_ref)  # Output: b'Hello, Ray!'\n```\n\nIn this example, we first initialize Ray using `ray.init()`. Then, we store a string \"Hello, Ray!\" in the object store using `ray.put` and get its object reference. Finally, we retrieve the object from the object store using `ray.get` and print it.\n\nNote that it's best practice to avoid calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily for intermediate steps and only call it at the end to get the final result. This is because when `ray.get()` is called, objects must be transferred to the worker/node that calls `ray.get()`. If you don't need to manipulate the object, you probably don't need to call `ray.get()` on it!",

You can then use ray.get() to fetch the result of a remote object from the object reference. If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the get call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, the object data is deserialized into a Python object. You can also set a timeout to return early from a get that's blocking for too long.

Load your data using Ray Data's `read_files` method, which returns a Ray Dataset.\n2. Apply any necessary preprocessing operations to the Dataset using Ray Data's preprocessors or other transformation methods.\n3. If your preprocessed Dataset is small enough to fit in Ray's object store memory, materialize it in the object store using the `materialize()` method. This will improve performance when iterating over the dataset repeatedly.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do this:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import dataframe as df\n\n# Load data from many text files\ndatasets = df.read_files('path/to/text_files/*.txt')\n\n# Preprocess the data using a Ray Data preprocessor\npreprocessor = df.TextPreprocessor(num_workers=4)\ndatasets = preprocessor.transform(datasets)\n\n# Materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray's object store if it's small enough\nif datasets.count() < (0.3 * ray.cluster_resources()['memory']) / datasets.row_size():\n    datasets = datasets.materialize()\n```\n\nIn this example, we're loading text files and applying a `TextPreprocessor` to them. The preprocessor splits the text into individual words and lowercases them. You can replace this with any preprocessing operation that suits your needs.\n\nNote that if your preprocessed dataset is too large to fit into Ray's object store memory, you should not call `materialize()`, as it will decrease performance due to disk spilling. In this case, you can still iterate over the Dataset repeatedly, but the preprocessing operations will be re-run each time.",

This is because `SSLContext` objects contain non-serializable components like thread locks. Ray's serialization is based on Pickle protocol version 5, which has some limitations in serializing certain types of objects, such as non-native objects. To work around this issue, you can convert the pickle-based checkpoint to a msgpack one using an RLlib utility function, as shown in the provided context.",
            "reference_answer": "To handle the 'can\u2019t pickle SSLContext objects' error, you can customize your serialization process. There are three ways to do this: 1) Define a __reduce__ function inside the corresponding class if you have access to the code. 2) If you can't access or modify the class, you can register the class with the serializer you use. 3) If you want to customize the serialization of a specific object, you can create a helper class for serialization. This helper class should have a __reduce__ method that returns the object and its serialized data.",

The actual model loading and inference logic is implemented within a custom class, so you don't need to directly use PyTorch or TensorFlow in your inference script. Instead, you can leverage Ray Datasets to handle the data processing and parallelization while using your pre-trained models for inference.",

The `col.allreduce()` function takes two arguments: the tensor to reduce and the name of the collective group to use. In this example, we are using the default group.\n\nYou can also use the `ray.train.lightning.RayFSDPStrategy.reduce()` function to reduce a tensor from several distributed processes to one aggregated tensor. This function takes three arguments: the tensor to reduce, the process group to gather results from, and the reduction operation. The default reduction operation is 'mean', but you can also use 'sum' to calculate the sum during reduction.\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nfrom ray.train.lightning import RayFSDPStrategy\n\nstrategy = RayFSDPStrategy()\n\ntensor = torch.tensor([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\nreduced_tensor = strategy.reduce(tensor)\n```\n\nThis will reduce the `tensor` using the default reduction operation 'mean'.",

            "generated_answer": " To write unit tests for Ray code, you can follow these tips:\n\n1. Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible to reduce overhead. You can do this by calling `ray.init()` once in the `setUp()` method of a `unittest.TestCase` subclass.\n2. Fix the resource quantity with `ray.init(num_cpus=...)` to ensure consistent resource allocation across tests.\n3. Consider creating a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` for more control over the cluster configuration.\n4. Be careful when running tests in parallel to avoid race conditions and other concurrency issues.\n5. Use `ray.shutdown()` and `assert not ray.is_initialized()` to ensure that Ray is properly shut down after each test.\n6. When testing Ray programs, it's important to consider the nature of parallel programs and the potential for non-deterministic behavior.\n\nHere's an example of how you might write a unit test for Ray code in Python:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n        assert not ray.is_initialized()\n\n    def test_my_ray_code(self):\n        # Test your Ray code here\n        pass\n```\n\nNote that this example assumes that you have already written the Ray code that you want to test. The test case sets up a Ray cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs in the `setUp()` method, and shuts down the cluster in the `tearDown()` method. You can then write your test in the `test_my_ray_code()` method.",
            "reference_answer": "To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the unittest module in Python. You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

            "generated_answer": " The GCS server, or Global Control Service, is a centralized metadata server that runs on the head node of a Ray cluster. It manages node membership and actor directory, and provides cluster-level operations like actor, placement groups, and node management. However, it does not have fault tolerance by default, meaning that if the GCS server fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. To make the GCS server fault tolerant, HA Redis can be used.\n\nThe reason why your GCS server might be taking up so much memory on the head node is because it is a memory-demanding system component that runs on the head node. The head node also has additional system processes running on it, such as GCS or the dashboard, which can contribute to increased memory usage. Additionally, if you are running tasks and actors from the head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems if the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes.\n\nTo alleviate memory pressure on the head node, you can consider tuning operating system settings to support a large number of network connections, or adjusting the hardware specification of the head node based on metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network bandwidth usage. You can also consider running tasks and actors on worker nodes instead of the head node.\n\nIf you want to run memory profiling on Ray core components, you can use Jemalloc and override LD\\_PRELOAD on core components. For example, to profile the gcs\\_server, you can set the RAY\\_JEMALLOC\\_LIB\\_PATH and RAY\\_JEMALLOC\\_CONF environment variables.",

Run `ray status` to view the detailed cluster status. This command will show you the status of each node in the cluster, including any pending nodes or recent failures.\n\n2. Check the autoscaler monitor log (`cat /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.*`) for any error messages or warnings that might help explain why the nodes are pending.\n\n3. Ensure that your Kubernetes resources are properly configured and that there are no errors in your YAML file. You can check the status of your pods using `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n\n4. If you're using Ray Tune with Kubernetes, make sure that you're using shared storage for checkpoints to avoid performance bottlenecks.\n\n5. If you're running multiple Ray Tune jobs on the same cluster at the same time, be aware that this is not officially supported and may cause resource contention.\n\n6. If you're using the Ray Dataset API, be aware that it can consume cluster resources, including CPUs. Make sure that you're not exceeding the available resources in your cluster.\n\n7.

            "generated_answer": " To get more detailed errors or logs when Ray Serve returns a generic internal service error due to an internal failure, you can:\n\n1. Check Python-level exceptions: Ray surfaces application-level failures as Python-level exceptions. When a task on a remote worker or actor fails due to a Python-level exception, Ray wraps the original exception in a RayTaskError and stores this as the task\u2019s return value. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result.\n\n2. Use Ray logging: Ray uses Python\u2019s standard logging module with a logger named \"ray.serve\". By default, logs are emitted from actors both to stderr and on disk on each node at /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/serve/. In development, logs are streamed to the driver Ray program, so it\u2019s convenient to keep the driver running while debugging.\n\n3. Enable detailed progress reporting: For Ray Data, you can run `ray.data.DataContext.get_current().execution_options.verbose_progress = True` for detailed progress reporting.\n\n4. Check the RayServe script: Ensure that your Ray Serve script is correct to avoid any issues. It is recommended to test your Ray Serve script locally or in a RayCluster before deploying it to a RayService.\n\n5. Fault tolerance: Ray provides mechanisms to handle application-level failures, such as catching errors, retrying failed code, and handling misbehaving code. Ray also provides mechanisms to automatically recover from internal system-level failures like node failures.\n\n6. RayService troubleshooting: If the issue pertains to the data plane, specifically your Ray Serve scripts or Ray Serve configurations, you can check the status and events of the RayService CR to see if there are any errors using `kubectl describe rayservice $RAYSERVICE_NAME -n $YOUR_NAMESPACE`.",

This function can restore an experiment from a local directory or a cloud storage location. If you used cloud checkpointing, you can restore from the S3 bucket path.\n\nHere's an example of how to restore an experiment from a cloud storage location:\n\n```python\nfrom ray import tune\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner.restore(\n    \"s3://my-checkpoints-bucket/path/my-tune-exp\",\n    trainable=my_trainable,\n    resume_errored=True\n)\ntuner.fit()\n```\n\nReplace `my_trainable` with your actual trainable function and update the S3 bucket path with your own path. The `resume_errored=True` argument allows you to resume an experiment that was previously stopped due to an error.\n\nAfter restoring the experiment, you can access the results and checkpoints by calling `Tuner.get_results()` to receive the `ResultGrid` object, and then proceed as needed.",

If there are not enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on, it can prevent Ray Data from scheduling tasks, reducing performance or causing workloads to hang. To ensure CPU resources are always available for Ray Data execution, you can limit the number of concurrent Tune trials with the max\\_concurrent\\_trials Tune option.",
            "reference_answer": "Your Ray tuner might be showing 'running' but CPU usage is almost 0% due to several reasons. It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

For example, `ray.get(object_ref, timeout=4)` will return the result of the task or function associated with `object_ref` within 4 seconds, or raise a `ray.exceptions.GetTimeoutError` if the result is not available within that time.\n\nNote that the `request_timeout_s` field in the `http_options` of the Serve config is a global setting that applies to all HTTP requests in the Ray cluster, and cannot be updated during runtime.

This could be due to several reasons such as:\n\n* The head node is not running or is inaccessible at the specified address.\n* A different version of Ray is running at the specified address.\n* The specified address is wrong.\n* There are firewall settings preventing access.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can use tools such as `nmap` or `nc` to check whether each port can be reached from a node. Additionally, you can customize the health-check frequency and timeout using the `health_check_period_s` and `health_check_timeout_s` options in the deployment configuration.\n\nIf the head node has failed, you can make the GCS fault tolerant by using HA Redis, which allows the GCS to recover its state when it restarts. This can prevent the Ray cluster from crashing if the head node goes down.\n\nIf you are using Kubernetes but not KubeRay, you can refer to the Kubernetes documentation for instructions on how to make the GCS fault tolerant. In this case, when the GCS restarts, it will recover the state by reading from Redis. If the raylet fails to reconnect to the GCS for more than 60 seconds, the raylet will exit and the corresponding node will fail. This timeout threshold can be tuned by the OS environment variable `RAY_gcs_rpc_server_reconnect_timeout_s`. You can also set the OS environment variable `RAY_external_storage_namespace` to isolate the data stored in Redis.",

Prevent running out of disk space by adjusting the `local_fs_capacity_threshold`.\n4. If using an HDD, specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.\n5. For memory-intensive workloads, use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling.\n6. Avoid passing large objects as values in the search space, as it incurs a performance overhead. Use `tune.with_parameters` to pass large objects in or load them from disk or cloud storage.\n7.

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed.

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).

Get a handle to the replica using its name: `replica_handle = ray.get_actor(\"SERVE_REPLICA::SleepyPid#RlRptP\", namespace=\"serve\")`\n2. Kill the replica using the handle: `ray.kill(replica_handle, no_restart=True)`\n\nThis will stop the replica without restarting it. You can check the status of the replica using the `ray list actors` command.",

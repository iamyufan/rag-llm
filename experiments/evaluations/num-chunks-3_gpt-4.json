The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node, increases or decreases the number of worker nodes in the cluster in response to task and actor resource requests.

You can configure the Ray autoscaler using the Ray cluster launcher.",

This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

Inspect the `get_global_worker` function and the `RolloutWorker` class in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py` to understand how they are implemented and how they interact with other components in the RLlib Algorithm.\n3. Add logging statements or use a debugger to identify the point of deadlock in the code.\n4. Ensure that the `num_workers` parameter is set correctly in the RLlib Algorithm, and that the number of `RolloutWorker` instances in the `WorkerSet` is consistent with this parameter.\n5. Check if there are any issues with the RL environment or the policy models used by the `RolloutWorker` instances, as these can also cause deadlocks or other issues during data collection.\n6. Verify that the sample API is being used correctly in the `RolloutWorker` class and that it is not causing any unintended side effects or deadlocks.\n7.

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support.

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

            "generated_answer": " To avoid objects not getting spilled, consider the following:\n\n1. Use high-performance storage such as NVMe SSDs for storing objects, as this can improve performance.\n2. Monitor the object store's capacity and ensure it's sufficient for your data processing needs.\n3. Optimize your application's memory usage to reduce the likelihood of object spilling.\n4. If possible, partition your data into smaller chunks to minimize the amount of data that needs to be spilled.\n\nRemember that object spilling is intended for memory-intensive distributed applications and comes with a performance penalty due to disk I/O.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects.

Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.

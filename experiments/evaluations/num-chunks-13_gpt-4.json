            "generated_answer": " Ray Serve's autoscaling feature automatically adjusts the number of replicas in a deployment based on its load. The Ray autoscaler, which runs on the head node, increases or decreases the number of worker nodes based on the resource demands of the Ray workload. It reacts to task and actor resource requests, not application metrics or physical resource utilization. Autoscaling can be configured using the Ray cluster launcher or on Kubernetes. It's recommended to start with non-autoscaling clusters if you're new to Ray. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that sits on top of the Ray Autoscaler, requesting replica actors based on demand. The autoscaler considers logical resource requests for scaling and adds nodes to satisfy resource demands in the queue. It also removes nodes after they become idle. The Ray Autoscaler complements the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler when using Ray on Kubernetes.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

Apache Spark is a mature and feature-rich framework for large-scale data processing, particularly excelling in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tasks and SQL queries. Dask is designed for parallel analytics and scientific computing workloads, providing big data collections that mimic NumPy and Pandas APIs, making it easier to scale up existing code. Ray is a high-performance distributed execution system, geared towards production, with a focus on general-purpose computing, including machine learning and AI workloads.\n\nDask can be integrated with Ray to leverage Ray's fast and fault-tolerant task execution system while using Dask's familiar APIs. This combination allows you to build data analyses using Dask's collections and execute them on a Ray cluster. However, Dask-on-Ray is not expected to achieve the same performance as using Ray directly.\n\nIn terms of batch processing workloads, Ray Data handles many of the same tasks as Apache Spark but with a streaming paradigm that is better suited for GPU workloads for deep learning inference. For a more detailed performance comparison between Ray Data and Apache Spark, you can refer to the Offline Batch Inference: Comparing Ray, Apache Spark, and SageMaker article.\n\nRayDP (Spark on Ray) combines Spark and Ray clusters, making it easy to do large-scale data processing using the PySpark API and seamlessly use that data to train models using TensorFlow and PyTorch. This can be useful when you want to use Spark for data processing and Ray for model training in the same application without having two different clusters.\n\nIn summary, Spark, Ray, and Dask all have their unique features and use cases. Dask can be integrated with Ray for a seamless experience when working with familiar NumPy and Pandas APIs, while Ray Data offers better performance for GPU workloads compared to Apache Spark. RayDP allows you to combine Spark and Ray clusters for large-scale data processing and model training.",

If a node is overloaded with more tasks than its resources allow, it may be necessary to reduce the number of concurrent tasks or increase the resources available to each task. This can be done by specifying resource requirements for each task or actor, such as `ray::Task(MyFunction).SetResource(\"CPU\", 1.0).SetResource(\"GPU\", 1.0).SetResource(\"special_hardware\", 1.0).Remote();` in C++. It is important to note that resource requirements are logical and do not impose limits on actual physical resource usage.

However, considering the information provided, it is recommended to use a GPU with at least 16 GB of memory and to leverage DeepSpeed to optimize memory usage. The example uses DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 3 to load large models without running out of memory.\n\nTo give you an idea, the usage example provided shows that the system has 2.00GiB of object\\_store\\_memory. However, this might not be sufficient for training the \u201cEleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\u201d model. You should ensure that your GPU has enough memory to hold the model and the dataset. Additionally, you may need to adjust the batch size to fit the model into the GPU memory.\n\nIn summary, to train the \u201cEleutherAI/gpt-j-6B\u201d model, use a GPU with at least 16 GB of memory and DeepSpeed to optimize memory usage. Adjust the batch size according to your GPU memory to prevent out-of-memory errors.",

After running the experiment, you can visualize the results by specifying the output directory of your results using the command `tensorboard --logdir=<output_directory>`. If you're running Ray on a remote multi-user cluster, you can make sure TensorBoard is able to write to the tmp directory by setting the TMPDIR environment variable.\n\nIn a distributed setup with multiple workers, TensorBoard will show the aggregated results from all the workers. However, note that by default, Ray Tune logs results for TensorBoard, CSV, and JSON formats, and if you need to log something lower level like model weights or gradients, you can use Trainable Logging.\n\nAdditionally, if you want to calculate optimization metrics besides accuracy and loss, such as recall, precision, Fbeta, etc., you can use third-party libraries or distributed primitives of your machine learning framework to report metrics from multiple workers.

            "generated_answer": " Based on the provided context, there are several possible reasons for nodes dying in a cluster:\n\n1. Overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections, which can be caused by autoscaling or user action.\n2. Head node failure, which results in the failure of the entire Ray cluster.\n3. Raylet failure, which marks the corresponding node as dead and treats it as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n4. Worker node failure, which results in the failure of all running tasks and actors on that node and the loss of objects owned by worker processes of this node.\n5. Memory pressure or running low on memory, which can cause tasks to be killed due to OOM (Out of Memory) errors.\n\nTo tolerate these failures, Ray cluster needs to make GCS fault-tolerant so that when a new head node is started, all the cluster-level data is still available. Similarly, when a worker node fails, the actors running on it also fail, and Serve detects that the actors have failed and attempts to respawn the actors on the remaining, healthy nodes. KubeRay detects that the node itself has failed, so it attempts to restart the worker pod on another running node and brings up a new healthy node to replace it. Once the node comes up, if the pod is still pending, it can be restarted on that node. Similarly, Serve can also respawn any pending actors on that node as well.",
            "reference_answer": "Nodes in a cluster can die due to Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues. This can occur when application tasks or actors consume a large amount of heap space, causing the node to run out of memory. When this happens, the operating system will start killing worker or raylet processes, disrupting the application. OOM may also stall metrics and if this happens on the head node, it may stall the dashboard or other control processes and cause the cluster to become unusable.",

If you want to create a non-autoscaling cluster, you can set `min_workers` and `max_workers` to the same value and use the `RayCluster` class instead.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that manually setting the cluster size may not be the most cost-effective or efficient option, as autoscaling can help reduce workload costs and improve resource utilization.

Incorrect configurations might lead to deadlocks or other issues.\n\n2. **Implement logging and debugging information**: Add print statements or use a logging library to print information about the state of the workers, environments, and policies during rollouts. This can help you identify which part of the code is causing the deadlock.\n\n3. **Use Ray's built-in tools for debugging**: Ray provides several tools for debugging, such as the Ray dashboard and the `ray profiler`. These tools can help you identify performance bottlenecks, resource contention, and other issues that might be causing deadlocks.\n\n4. **Inspect the Ray dashboard**: The Ray dashboard provides a visual representation of the Ray cluster, including information about tasks, actors, and resources. By examining the dashboard, you can identify if there are any issues with task execution, resource allocation, or other aspects of the Ray cluster that might be causing deadlocks.\n\n5. **Implement error handling and retry mechanisms**: Implement error handling and retry mechanisms in your code to ensure that deadlocks or other issues do not cause the entire system to fail. This can help you identify which tasks are failing and why, and allow you to retry those tasks to see if the issue has been resolved.\n\n6. **Use Ray's `WorkerSet.foreach_worker_async` or `WorkerSet.foreach_worker` methods**: These methods allow you to call a function on each worker in the WorkerSet, either asynchronously or synchronously. By using these methods, you can debug each worker individually and identify which worker is causing the deadlock.\n\n7. **Check the `par_iter_slice_batch` method in `RolloutWorker`**: This method batches the parallel iteration slices. If there is an issue with the batching or slicing, it might cause a deadlock.\n\n8. **Check the synchronous, single-threaded actor execution**: Ray executes tasks from the same submitter in a synchronous, single-threaded manner. If there is an issue with task submission or execution order, it might cause a deadlock.\n\n9. **Check the Counter example**: The provided Counter example demonstrates how to create a simple Ray actor that can be used to debug synchronous, single-threaded actor execution. By examining this example, you can identify if there are any issues with task submission or execution order in your code.\n\n10. **Check the environment and offline data sampling**: Data ingest via environment rollouts or offline files is done in RLlib by RolloutWorker instances.

You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support.

Note that this operation will trigger the execution of any lazy transformations performed on the dataset.\n\nKeep in mind that the `union` function does not perform a SQL-like join (e.g., inner join, left join, etc.) but simply concatenates the datasets. If you need to perform a SQL-like join, you would need to implement it manually, for example, by filtering and merging the datasets based on a common column.",

This method materializes and zips the columns of one dataset with the columns of another. The datasets must have the same number of rows. Their column sets are merged, and any duplicate column names are disambiguated with suffixes like '_1'. The smaller of the two datasets is repartitioned to align the number of rows per block with the larger dataset.

Fault tolerance: Ray handles actor fault tolerance in case of actor process death or owner death.\n4. Useful for synchronization: Actors can be used to synchronize other tasks and actors when multiple tasks need to wait on some condition or synchronize across tasks and actors on a cluster.\n\nDisadvantages of using a singleton Actor in Ray:\n\n1. Overhead for simple tasks: If you don't need the stateful part of an actor, you're mostly better off using tasks, as actors come with additional overhead.\n2. Performance issues with global variables: Using global variables to share state between tasks and actors is an anti-pattern and can harm performance.\n3.

To resolve this issue, you can use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store and then pass them by object ID to the actor. Additionally, you may want to consider reducing the size of the actor or increasing the amount of object store memory available to Ray.\n\nIn the context provided, it is recommended to move the data loader to the training function and to use `ray.put()` to put large objects in the Ray object store. It is also suggested to use an autoscaling actor pool for the inference stage and to set the `max_tasks_in_flight_per_actor` parameter to 2 or greater to increase opportunities for pipelining task dependency prefetching with computation and avoid actor startup delays.\n\nHere is an example of how you can modify your code to use `ray.put()` to put a large model object in the Ray object store and then pass it to the `TorchPredictor` actor:\n\n```python\n# Put the model object in the Ray object store\nmodel_ref = ray.put(model)\n\n# Create the TorchPredictor actor and pass the model object ID as an argument\ntorchtorch_predictor_actor = TorchPredictor.remote(model_ref)\n\n# Use the TorchPredictor actor to make predictions\npredictions = ds.map_batches(\n    TorchPredictor,\n    num_gpus=1,\n    batch_size=1,\n    compute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=2, max_tasks_in_flight_per_actor=2),\n    f=torchtorch_predictor_actor\n)\n```\n\nThis will put the `model` object in the Ray object store and then pass its object ID (`model_ref`) to the `TorchPredictor` actor. The actor can then retrieve the model object from the object store using the object ID. This can help to reduce the size of the actor and avoid the ValueError.",

First, create a list of actors.\n2. Then, create a collective group using `ray.util.collective.create_collective_group`.\n3. Perform the all\\_reduce operation using `ray.util.collective.allreduce`.\n\nHere's some example code:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.collective import allreduce, create_collective_group\n\n# Create a list of actors\nactors = [BatchPredictor.remote(model_ref) for _ in range(num_actors)]\n\n# Create a collective group\ngroup = create_collective_group(actors, world_size=num_actors, ranks=list(range(num_actors)), backend='nccl', group_name='default')\n\n# Perform the all_reduce operation\nresult = allreduce(input_data, op=allreduce.SUM, group=group)\n```\n\nIn this example, `input_data` is the data you want to perform the all\\_reduce operation on. The `op` parameter specifies the reduction operation (in this case, summation). The `group` parameter specifies the collective group to use for the operation. The result of the all\\_reduce operation will be stored in the `result` variable.",
            "reference_answer": "To perform an all_reduce operation among a list of actors, you can use the 'apply_reduce' function provided in the context. This function takes in the results from each actor, and reduces them into a single output by adding up all word occurrences. The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine. The final result is a dictionary of word counts, which is then sorted and printed.",

For an in-depth guide on shuffle performance, see the [Performance Tips and Tuning](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/performance.html) page.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that there are two approaches to random shuffling in Ray Data: shuffling data blocks and local shuffling on each training worker, and full global shuffle. The former is less expensive and may suffice for most cases, while the latter is more expensive and will fully decorrelate row iteration order from the original dataset order.\n\nYou can specify the shuffle implementation during program execution by setting the `RAY_DATA_SHUFFLE_IMPL` environment variable to either `'auto'`, `'block'`, or `'global'`. For example:\n```\n# Use the block-based shuffle implementation\n$ RAY_DATA_SHUFFLE_IMPL=block python my_script.py\n```\nFor more information, see the [Shuffling rows](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/data/shuffle.html#shuffling-rows) page.",

To integrate with asyncio, Ray provides the `asyncio.run(async_get())` function to run the event loop and process the results asynchronously.

            "generated_answer": " To debug a hanging `ray.get()` call, there are a few things to consider. First, `ray.get()` is a blocking call, which means it waits until the requested result is available. If you call `ray.get()` in a loop, the loop will not continue to run until the call to `ray.get()` is resolved. This can harm parallelism, as you wait for the previous function call to finish before spawning the next call in the next iteration of the loop.\n\nTo avoid this, you can separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. This way, all remote functions are spawned before you wait for the results, allowing them to run in parallel in the background. Additionally, you can pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` instead of calling it one by one to wait for all of the tasks to finish.\n\nAnother anti-pattern to avoid is calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily for intermediate steps. If you don't need to manipulate the object, you probably don't need to call `ray.get()` on it. It's best practice to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get()`, or even design your program to avoid having to call `ray.get()` at all.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, you can use Ray's built-in debugger to set breakpoints in your Ray tasks and actors and inspect variables in that context, step within that task or actor, move up or down the stack, and more. However, keep in mind that the Ray Debugger is an experimental feature and is currently unstable.",
            "reference_answer": "To debug a hanging `ray.get()` call, you can use the Ray dashboard to view stack traces by clicking on the 'Stack Trace' actions for active worker processes, actors, and job\u2019s driver process.

If you want to kill the actor immediately, you can use the `ray.kill(actor)` function.

If you want to allow the actor to be restarted, you can pass `no_restart=False` to the `ray.kill()` function.\n\nNote: Actors are automatically garbage collected, so you generally should not need to manually terminate them. You can wait for the actor to exit by calling `ray.get()` on the object ref resulting from the task that created the actor. This will raise a `RayActorError` if the actor has already exited.",

This tells Ray to schedule the task to a node that has a free GPU and assign the GPU to the task. The specific GPU type is not specified in this decorator, so it's up to you to ensure that the node where the task is running has a V100 GPU available.\n\nHere is an example of how you can define a task that runs on a V100 GPU:\n```\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef my_task():\n    # Your task code here\n    ...\n```\nNote that the `num_gpus` argument in the `@ray.remote` decorator only specifies the number of GPUs to reserve for the task, it does not guarantee that a specific type of GPU will be used. To ensure that your task runs on a V100 GPU, you will need to make sure that the node where the task is running has a V100 GPU available.\n\nAlso note that the actual GPU utilization is not controlled or limited by Ray, it is up to the task to make use of the GPU. This is typically done through an external library like TensorFlow.\n\nYou can check the GPU IDs assigned to a task or actor by calling `ray.get_gpu_ids()` inside the task or actor.\n```\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\nclass GPUActor:\n    def ping(self):\n        print(\"ray.get_gpu_ids(): {}\".format(ray.get_gpu_ids()))\n```\nTypically, it is not necessary to call `ray.get_gpu_ids()` because Ray will automatically set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable, which most ML frameworks will respect for purposes of GPU assignment.",

            "generated_answer": " To update files in the working directory, you can use the `with open(filepath, \"w\")` context manager to write to a file, where `filepath` is a string specifying the path to the file. When using Tune, the current working directory of the trainable is set to the corresponding trial directory, so you can use relative paths to write to files. If you need to write to a specific directory, you can use the `to_directory([path])` function to write checkpoint data to the specified directory. Additionally, if you're running Ray on multiple machines, you'll need to make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes.\n\nHere's an example of how you can write to a file in the current working directory:\n```\nwith open(\"./artifact.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"Artifact Data\")\n```\nAnd here's an example of how you can write to a specific directory:\n```\nimport ray\n\nray.put(\"some_data\", to_directory=\"/path/to/directory\")\n```\nYou can also use the `to_directory` function to write checkpoint data to a specific directory.\n```\nray.train.checkpoint.save_checkpoint(checkpoint_path=\"/path/to/directory\", ...)\n```\nIt's important to note that the working directory is shared between workers, so you should use the `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` API to get the path for saving trial-specific outputs.\n\nAlso, you can use `cluster_synced_files` and `file_mounts` to sync files and directories from the head node to the worker nodes.\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"cluster_synced_files\": [\"/path/to/file\"]})\n```\nYou can also use `file_mounts` to mount a directory from the head node to the worker nodes.\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"file_mounts\": [(\"/path/to/directory\", \"/mount/path\")]})\n```\nYou can also use `rsync_exclude` to exclude certain files or directories when syncing or mounting.\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"file_mounts\": [(\"/path/to/directory\", \"/mount/path\")], \"rsync_exclude\": [\"**/.git\"]})\n```\nYou can also disable the behavior of changing the working directory by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR=0` environment variable. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes, and you must make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.",

This will ensure that each trial has its own separate working directory, and avoid issues with multiple workers accidentally writing to the same location.\n\nNote that the current working directory of both functional and class trainables is set to the corresponding trial directory once it\u2019s been launched as a remote Ray actor. Therefore, you should use the trial directory as the path to save any outputs, rather than the original working directory.\n\nYou can also disable the behavior of changing the working directory to the trial directory by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR` environment variable to `0`. This will allow access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes, and you must make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\nFinally, you can use the `ray submit` command to upload and run a script on the specified Ray cluster, and make the contents of the directory passed as `--working-dir` available to the Ray job by downloading the directory to all nodes in your cluster.",

            "generated_answer": " The GCS (Global Control Service) is a centralized metadata server that runs on the head node of a Ray cluster, managing node membership and actor directory, as well as providing cluster-level operations like actor, placement groups, and node management. It stores all data in-memory, which means its failure can cause the entire Ray cluster to fail. To make the GCS fault tolerant, HA Redis is required.\n\nThe head node has more memory-demanding system components such as GCS or the dashboard, and the driver runs from a head node by default. If the head node has the same memory capacity as worker nodes and if you execute the same number of Tasks and Actors from a head node, it can easily have out-of-memory problems. In this case, you can specify --num-cpus=0 when starting a head node to prevent running any Tasks and Actors on the head node.\n\nYour GCS server might be taking up so much memory on the head node due to more than 1024 connections to the component, which is common for the head node GCS process because it is a centralized component that many other components in Ray communicate with. You can adjust the max file descriptors limit per process via the ulimit command, such as ulimit -n 65536, to handle more workers and nodes.\n\nAdditionally, because all nodes and workers connect to the GCS, many network connections will be created, and the operating system has to support that number of connections. The head node needs to open several more ports, including the GCS server port (default: 6379), Ray Client Server listening port (default: 10001), non-primary Redis shards ports (default: random values), the gRPC port used by the dashboard (default: random value), and the dashboard port (default: 8265) if --include-dashboard is true. Make sure the head node has sufficient bandwidth, as the most heavily stressed resource on the head node is outbound bandwidth.",

Also, the default batch format is fixed to NumPy. To revert to legacy behavior temporarily, set the environment variable `RAY_DATA_STRICT_MODE=0` on all cluster processes.\n\nYou can use Ray's built-in dashboard to understand and debug Ray applications. To learn more about Ray Data, you can refer to the Ray Data documentation and the Ray AI Runtime Libraries Quickstart guide.\n\nWhen using Ray Data for offline inference, you can follow these basic steps:\n\n1. Load your data into a Ray Dataset.\n2. Define a Python class to load the pre-trained model.\n3. Transform your dataset using the pre-trained model.\n4. Get the final predictions.\n\nFor custom PyTorch Datasets, you can migrate to Ray Data by converting the logic in `__getitem__` to Ray Data read and transform operations.

When a task is cancelled, it raises a TaskCancelledError if the task has been scheduled or interrupted. Only async actor tasks can be interrupted in Ray. Unscheduled tasks, if not scheduled yet, can be cancelled, and invoking ray.get(actor\\_task\\_ref) will produce a TaskCancelledError. For running actor tasks, Ray offers no mechanism for interruption. If a task is hanging, you can cancel the task by calling ray.cancel on an ObjectRef returned by the task. This will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is mid-execution. Note that currently, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.",

It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

            "generated_answer": " To make the GPU available on your M1 laptop for Ray, you need to ensure that Ray is installed correctly on your M1 Mac. Ray officially supports Apple silicon (M1) hardware. Here are the steps to install Ray on your M1 Mac:\n\n1. Install miniforge by running the following commands in your terminal:\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh\nbash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh\nrm Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh # Cleanup.\n```\n2. Ensure you're using the miniforge environment by activating it in your terminal:\n```bash\nsource ~/.bash_profile\nconda activate\n```\n3. Install Ray as you normally would by running the following command:\n```\npip install ray\n```\n\nOnce Ray is installed, you can use the `num_gpus` parameter in the `@ray.remote` decorator to specify the number of GPUs required for a particular task. For example, the following code specifies that the `use_gpu` function requires 1 GPU:\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    print(\"ray.get_gpu_ids(): {}\".format(ray.get_gpu_ids()))\n    print(\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: {}\".format(os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"]))\n```\nNote that Ray automatically sets the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to make the specified GPUs visible to Ray. If you want to limit the GPUs that are visible to Ray, you can use the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable to specify the GPUs that Ray should see. For example, the following command starts Ray and limits it to using GPUs 1 and 3:\n```bash\nCUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,3 ray start --head --num-gpus=2\n```\nHowever, it's important to note that Ray does not automatically handle GPU sharing or memory management for multiple trials. If you want to use multiple GPUs per trial, you should check out LightningTrainer. Additionally, Ray does not provide native integration with GPU profiling tools. You can try running GPU profilers like Pytorch Profiler without Ray to identify any issues.",
            "reference_answer": "To make the GPU available on your M1 laptop for Ray, you need to first install miniforge. You can do this by downloading it from the provided link using wget, then running the downloaded script. After installation, ensure you're using the miniforge environment by sourcing your bash profile and activating conda. Finally, install Ray as you normally would using pip.",

            "question": "How can I add a timeout for the Ray job?",
            "generated_answer": " To add a timeout for a Ray job, you can use the `timeout_s` field in the relevant configuration for the job. For example, if you're running a Horovod job with Ray, you can set the `HorovodConfig.timeout_s` field to specify the timeout in seconds.\n\nHere's an example of how to set the timeout for a Horovod job:\n```python\nfrom ray.train.horovod import HorovodConfig\n\nHorovodConfig.timeout_s = 300  # Set timeout to 300 seconds\n```\nAlternatively, you can also set a timeout for a specific `get` call to wait for a result from a remote function. You can do this by wrapping the `get` call in a try-except block and catching the `GetTimeoutError` exception.\n\nHere's an example of how to set a timeout for a `get` call:\n```python\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\n@ray.remote\ndef long_running_function():\n    time.sleep(8)\n\nobj_ref = long_running_function.remote()\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)\nexcept GetTimeoutError:\n    print(\"`get` timed out.\")\n```\nIn this example, the `get` call will timeout after 4 seconds and raise a `GetTimeoutError` exception. The exception is caught and handled by printing a message.",

This option allows you to specify a local disk path where the ray temporary data will be stored. The cluster will create a subdirectory beneath this path for the temporary files of the cluster.\n\nFor example, if you want to set the temporary directory to `/custom/tmp`, you can start the cluster with the following command:\n\n```\nray start --head --ray-temp-root-dir=/custom/tmp\n```\n\nThis will create a subdirectory called `ray-<head_port>-<random_suffix>` beneath `/custom/tmp` where the temporary files for the cluster will be stored.\n\nNote that this option only works when the `--head` flag is specified, and it is currently not possible to set a local directory per-task or per-actor. If the local directory contains a `.gitignore` file, the files and paths specified there will not be uploaded to the cluster. You can disable this by setting the environment variable `RAY_RUNTIME_ENV_IGNORE_GITIGNORE=1` on the machine doing the uploading.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",

A higher value for the `smoothing_factor` will result in a more rapid response to changes, while a lower value will result in a more gradual response. This parameter can be adjusted to control the sensitivity of the autoscaler to changes in traffic volume.",

There are two types of smoothing factors: `upscale_smoothing_factor` and `downscale_smoothing_factor`. The `upscale_smoothing_factor` can be increased to scale up resources quickly when there is high traffic volume in a short period of time. On the other hand, the `downscale_smoothing_factor` can be decreased to slow down the pace of downscaling, making the application less sensitive to drops in traffic.",

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM.

            "generated_answer": " The error message you're seeing, \"Health check failed for node,\" is likely related to the Global Control Service (GCS) in Ray. The GCS is a critical component of Ray that manages cluster-level metadata and provides node management. If the GCS fails, then functions like actor creation, deletion, and resource management will not be available.\n\nTo make the GCS fault tolerant, you need to use HA Redis. This will allow the GCS to recover and resume regular functions when it restarts. During the recovery period, some functions will not be available, but the node should still be up and running.\n\nBased on the context provided, some possible causes for this error include:\n\n* The GCS server process has failed in the head Pod. You can check the log directory /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/ in the head Pod for errors related to the GCS server.\n* The ray executable is not included in the $PATH for the image, so the init container will fail to run ray health-check.\n* The CLUSTER_DOMAIN environment variable is not set correctly.\n\nTo troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check the GCS server logs for any errors.\n2. Verify that the ray executable is included in the $PATH for the image.\n3. Check that the CLUSTER_DOMAIN environment variable is set correctly.\n4. If you are using HA Redis, make sure it is properly configured and running.\n5. If the issue persists, you may need to restart the Ray cluster or the affected node.",

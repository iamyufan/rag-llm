The function you provide to `map_batches()` should take a batch of data as input and return a transformed batch of data. By default, Ray Data represents batches as dictionaries of NumPy ndarrays, but you can specify a different batch format using the `batch_format` argument in `map_batches()`.\n\nHere is an example of using `map_batches()` to increase the brightness of images in a dataset:\n\n```\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness, batch_format=\"numpy\")\n)\n```\n\nIf your function doesn't mutate the input batch, you can improve performance and decrease memory utilization by setting `zero_copy_batch=True` in `map_batches()`.\n\nI hope this helps!

It's configured using the Ray autoscaler, which is a Ray cluster process that scales the cluster up and down based on resource demand. The autoscaler reacts to task and actor resource requests, and not application metrics or physical resource utilization. When Ray Serve scales down, it tries to terminate replica actors in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler removes those nodes. The autoscaler only considers logical resource requests for scaling, not physical machine utilization. Autoscaling can reduce workload costs but adds node launch overheads and can be tricky to configure.",

This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider.

If a node is overloaded with more tasks than its resources allow, it could be due to incorrect resource specifications for the tasks. To prevent this, you can reduce the number of tasks per node by increasing the resources requested by each task, or by specifying a custom resource and limiting the number of tasks that can access it.

            "generated_answer": " There are several possible reasons for nodes dying in a cluster:\n\n1. Head node failure: When the head node fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. This can be simulated by killing the head pod or the head node. To tolerate head node failures, GCS (Global Control Store) needs to be made fault-tolerant so that when a new head node starts, all the cluster-level data is still available.\n2. Raylet failure: When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated the same as a node failure. Each raylet is associated with a unique ID, so even if it restarts on the same physical machine, it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n3. Worker node failure: A worker node failure can be simulated in a Kubernetes cluster. When a worker node fails, it can cause tasks, actors, and objects to be affected.\n4. Memory pressure: If a node experiences memory pressure, it may kill workers due to memory pressure (OOM), causing tasks and actors to be affected.\n5. User action: A cluster may terminate due to user action, which can cause nodes to die.\n6. Overloading the head node: Overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can cause the worker nodes to fail to connect to the cluster, leading to node death.\n\nTo prevent node death, it is essential to monitor the cluster's health, ensure that there is enough memory and CPU resources, and avoid overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections.",
            "reference_answer": "Nodes in a cluster can die due to Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues. This can occur when application tasks or actors consume a large amount of heap space, causing the node to run out of memory. When this happens, the operating system will start killing worker or raylet processes, disrupting the application. OOM may also stall metrics and if this happens on the head node, it may stall the dashboard or other control processes and cause the cluster to become unusable.",

This function commands the autoscaler to scale the cluster up to a desired size with immediate effect, bypassing normal upscaling speed constraints.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources import request_resources\n\n# Connect to the Ray cluster\nray.init(address=\"auto\")\n\n# Request resources to set the target cluster size\nrequest_resources(num_cpus=desired_cluster_size)\n```\nNote that this function only sets the target cluster size and does not guarantee that the cluster will reach that size immediately. The actual time taken to reach the target size will depend on various factors, such as the availability of resources in the cloud provider and the current cluster size.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that manually setting the cluster size may lead to resource underutilization or overprovisioning, depending on the workload.

You can deploy a fixed-size Ray cluster or one that autoscales based on the resources requested by applications running on the cluster. While it is possible to run multiple jobs from different users simultaneously in a Ray cluster, it is not recommended for production due to the lack of strong resource isolation and priority support.",

Unique name: An actor can be given a unique name within their namespace, allowing you to retrieve the actor from any job in the Ray cluster.\n2. Accessibility: This can be useful if you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it, or if you are trying to access an actor launched by another driver.\n3. Get-Or-Create: Ray provides a get\\_if\\_exists option for actor creation that creates an actor only if it doesn\u2019t exist.\n4. Namespace: Named actors are scoped by namespace. If no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default.\n5. Lifetime: Named actors can have a lifetime that is independent of the creator, allowing for more flexible scheduling of tasks and actors.\n\nIn the context of your query, using a named actor for MyTFPolicy can provide a unique name for the policy, allowing it to be retrieved and used later in the Ray cluster.

            "generated_answer": " To set a maximum episode length in RLlib, you can use the `sample_async` argument in the `Trainer` constructor. This argument allows you to specify a function that determines when an episode should be terminated. For example, you can use a function that terminates an episode after a certain number of steps have been taken. Here is an example of how you can use this argument to set a maximum episode length of 100 steps:\n```\ndef should_terminate(episode, **kwargs):\n    return len(episode.last_timestep().steps) >= 100\n\ntrainer = Trainer(\n    env=\"YourEnv\",\n    config={\n        \"sample_async\": True,\n        \"sample_async_args\": {\n            \"should_terminate\": should_terminate,\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\nAlternatively, you can also set the maximum episode length by modifying the environment's `reset` method to return a done flag after a certain number of steps. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n```\nclass YourEnv(gym.Env):\n    def __init__(self, max_episode_length=100):\n        self.max_episode_length = max_episode_length\n\n    def reset(self, **kwargs):\n        self.current_step = 0\n        observation = self.observation_space.sample()\n        return observation, False\n\n    def step(self, action):\n        observation, reward, done, info = super().step(action)\n        self.current_step += 1\n        done = self.current_step >= self.max_episode_length\n        return observation, reward, done, info\n```\nThis will terminate the episode after `max_episode_length` steps have been taken.\n\nI hope this helps!

You can adjust the number of retries according to your needs.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_error` and `ray.tune.Callback.on_trial_recover` callbacks to customize the behavior when a trial fails or is recovered.

This will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is currently in mid-execution. If you want to force-exit the worker, you can pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel()`. Note that Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\n\nThis cancellation approach aligns with the standards presented in asyncio task cancellation. Note that asyncio.Task won\u2019t be interrupted in the middle of execution if you don\u2019t await within the async function. Ray attempts to cancel Tasks on a best-effort basis, meaning cancellation isn\u2019t always guaranteed. You can check if a Task was successfully cancelled using `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`.\n\nFor Actor Tasks, if the specified Task is pending execution, it is cancelled and not executed. If the Task is currently executing, the behavior depends on the execution model of an Actor. If it is a regular Actor or a threaded Actor, the execution isn\u2019t cancelled. Actor Tasks cannot be interrupted because Actors have states. If it is an async Actor, Ray cancels a asyncio.Task. The semantic of cancellation is equivalent to asyncio\u2019s cancellation. If the Task has finished, nothing happens. Only `force=False` is allowed for an Actor Task. Otherwise, it raises ValueError. Use `ray.kill(actor)` instead to kill an Actor.\n\nTo cancel an Actor Task, you can also call `ray.cancel()` on the returned Object Ref.\n\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    async def f(self):\n        try:\n            await asyncio.sleep(5)\n        except asyncio.CancelledError:\n            print(\"Actor task canceled.\")\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nref = actor.f.remote()\n\n# Wait until task is scheduled.\ntime.sleep(1)\nray.cancel(ref)\n```",

However, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled. If there are memory leaks on a worker due to application-level code, you can set the max_calls option in a task\u2019s @ray.remote decorator to make progress.

This reference can then be used to retrieve the object using `ray.get(object_ref)`.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Put an object in the object store\nobj_ref = ray.put(\"Hello, Ray!\")\n\n# Get the object from the object store\nobj = ray.get(obj_ref)\nprint(obj)  # Output: 'Hello, Ray!'\n```\n\nIn this example, we first initialize Ray using `ray.init()`. Then, we store a string \"Hello, Ray!\" in the object store using `ray.put()`, which returns an object reference (`obj_ref`). Finally, we retrieve the object from the object store using `ray.get(obj_ref)` and print it.\n\nNote that `ray.get()` is a blocking operation, meaning it will wait until the object is available in the object store. If you want to wait for the object to be available without retrieving it, you can use `ray.wait()`.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that unnecessary use of `ray.get()` can harm performance, as it requires transferring objects to the worker/node that calls `ray.get()`. It's best practice to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get()` or even design your program to avoid having to call `ray.get()` at all.",

If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the get call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, the object data is deserialized into a Python object. You can also set a timeout to return early from a get that's blocking for too long.

Load the data using Ray Data's `read_files` function, which supports reading data from various file formats.\n2. Preprocess the data using Ray Data's preprocessors, which are a higher-level API for transforming tabular and structured data. These preprocessors can be applied to the dataset before passing it into a Trainer.\n3. Materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray's built-in object store if it's small enough to fit in memory. This will compute the entire preprocessed dataset and pin it in memory, so that when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run.\n\nHere's an example of how to use Ray Data preprocessors for preprocessing structured data:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data.preprocessors import MinMaxScaler\nfrom ray.train.xgboost import XGBoostTrainer\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\n\n# Load data\ntrain_dataset = ray.data.read_files(\"path/to/train/*.csv\")\n\n# Preprocess data\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\ntrain_dataset = scaler.fit_transform(train_dataset)\n\n# Materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray's object store\ntrain_dataset = train_dataset.materialize()\n\n# Use the preprocessed dataset with a Trainer\ntrainer = XGBoostTrainer(...)\nscaling_config = ScalingConfig(...)\nray.train.run(trainer, config=scaling_config, dataset=train_dataset)\n```\n\nNote that if the preprocessed data is too large to fit into Ray object store memory, it's not recommended to materialize the dataset, as it will decrease performance due to disk spills. In this case, you can use Ray Data's streaming capabilities to preprocess and ingest the data for ML training pipelines.",

Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\n1. First, define a remote function that performs an allreduce on a tensor using the `ray.util.collective.allreduce` function:\n```python\n@ray.remote\ndef allreduce_worker(tensor):\n    ray.util.collective.allreduce(tensor, group_name=\"my_group\")\n    return tensor\n```\n2. Next, create some worker actors and pass each of them a tensor to allreduce:\n```python\nworkers = [Worker.remote() for i in range(5)]\ntensors = [ray.put(cupy.ones((10,), dtype=cupy.float32)) for _ in range(5)]\n```\n3. Now, you can call the `allreduce_worker` function on each of the worker actors, passing in the tensor for that actor:\n```python\nreduced_tensors = ray.get([allreduce_worker.remote(tensor) for tensor in tensors])\n```\nIn this example, we're creating 5 worker actors and passing each of them a tensor to allreduce. We're using the `ray.put` function to create Ray objects for each tensor, which allows us to pass them between actors. Finally, we're calling the `allreduce_worker` function on each of the worker actors and storing the results in the `reduced_tensors` list.\n\nNote that in this example, we're using a custom group name (\"my\\_group\") to specify which actors should participate in the allreduce operation. You can use any group name that you like, as long as all of the actors that you want to participate in the allreduce are part of the same group.",
            "reference_answer": "To perform an all_reduce operation among a list of actors, you can use the 'apply_reduce' function provided in the context. This function takes in the results from each actor, and reduces them into a single output by adding up all word occurrences. The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine. The final result is a dictionary of word counts, which is then sorted and printed.",

Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible to avoid the overhead of creating a new cluster for each test. You can do this by calling `ray.init()` before running any tests and `ray.shutdown()` after all tests have finished.\n2. Fix the resource quantity with `ray.init(num_cpus=...)` to ensure that each test has consistent resources.\n3. Consider creating a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` for more complex tests.\n4. Be careful when running tests in parallel to avoid race conditions.\n\nHere is an example of how to set up a basic test case for Ray:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n\n    def test_my_ray_code(self):\n        # Test your Ray code here.\n        pass\n```\n\nYou can then run your tests using a test runner like `unittest.main()`.\n\nNote that if you are testing Tune specifically, you can follow the instructions in the Tune documentation for setting up and running tests.",

To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method.

This will immediately terminate the actor, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def ping(self):\n        return \"hello\"\n\ndetached_actor = Actor.options(name=\"actor\", lifetime=\"detached\").remote()\n\n# ... use the actor ...\n\nray.kill(detached_actor)\n```\nNote that this will not go through the normal teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `std::atexit` or `atexit` will not be called. Also, subsequent calls to get the actor handle via `ray.get_actor()` will fail.\n\nIf you want to terminate the actor gracefully, you can wait for any previously submitted tasks to finish executing and then exit the process gracefully with `sys.exit()`. However, this is not currently implemented in Ray for C++ actors.\n\nFor non-detached actors, Ray will automatically terminate them when all actor handles to them in Python are deleted. This will cause them to complete any outstanding work and then shut down. If you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call `ray.kill(actor)`.",

However, it's important to note that if your tasks are very small or have variable durations, you might not see speedups due to Ray's task overhead and the need to batch tasks together for better performance.\n\nAdditionally, when specifying resources for Ray tasks or actors, you can use the `num_cpus` and `num_gpus` parameters to reserve the desired number of CPUs and GPUs. These parameters can be set as integers or floats, with floats allowing for packing multiple replicas together on a machine with fewer CPUs or GPUs than replicas.\n\nFor example, if you have a Ray actor that requires 1 CPU when it is scheduled, you can set `num_cpus=1` in the actor's configuration. However, after the actor is created, it will occupy 0 CPU by default.

This way, you don't need to explicitly put the module into the object store and get it back. Here is an example:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef my_custom_module():\n    # Define the custom module here\n    def some_function():\n        # Implementation of the function\n        pass\n    return some_function\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def do_something(self):\n        # Call the custom module remotely\n        result = ray.get(my_custom_module.remote()())\n        return result\n```\nIn this example, `my_custom_module.remote()` creates a remote function that can be called from the Actor, and `my_custom_module.remote()()` calls the remote function to get the result.\n\nNote that in both examples, the custom module needs to be defined before it is used in the Actor. This is because the Actor is a remote object that runs in a separate process, and it cannot access the local variables of the main process. Therefore, the custom module needs to be defined in the main process and then put into the object store or turned into a remote function, so that it can be accessed by the Actor.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.",
            "reference_answer": "To push a custom module to ray which is being used by Actor, you can use the 'py_modules' field in the 'runtime_env' parameter of the 'ray.init' function. You need to pass the module as a list to 'py_modules'. For example: ray.init('ray://123.456.7.89:10001', runtime_env={'py_modules': [my_module]}).

By default, Ray's logging level is set to `logging.INFO`. If it is set to a higher level (e.g., `logging.ERROR`), you will not see `log.info` messages.\n2. **Ray logger**: Make sure you are using Ray's logger to emit the log messages. You can get the Ray logger instance using `logger = logging.getLogger(\"ray\")`.\n3. **Driver logs**: If you are running the Ray Job by executing the Ray Driver on the Head node directly or connecting via Ray Client, the Driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you can view the Driver logs in the terminal or Jupyter Notebook output.\n4. **Log APIs**: You can use Ray's `list_logs` and `get_log` functions to list and retrieve log files. For example, you can use `list_logs(node_id=<NODE_ID>)` to list logs from a specific node or `get_log(actor_id=<ACTOR_ID>)` to retrieve logs for a specific actor.\n5. **Log directory**: By default, Ray writes logs to files in the directory `/tmp/ray/session_*/logs` on each Ray node's file system. Make sure that the log files are being written to the correct directory and that you have permission to access them.\n\nIf you have checked all of the above and are still unable to see `log.info` messages in Ray logs, please provide more context or details about your setup and the issue you are facing.",

However, you cannot set it directly to 10 because the context provided has a maximum limit of 2 for `max_workers`. To overcome this, you can use the `ray up` command with the `--min-workers` and `--max-workers` options to override the configured min and max worker node counts for the cluster.\n\nHere's an example of how to create a `config.yaml` file:\n\n```yaml\ncluster_name: my-ray-cluster\nmax_workers: 2\n\ndocker:\n  image: \"rayproject/ray-ml:2.0.0\"\n  container_name: \"ray_container\"\n\nprovider:\n  type: aws\n  region: us-west-2\n  availability_zone: us-west-2a\n\nauth:\n  ssh_user: ubuntu\n\nworker_start_ray_commands:\n  - ray stop\n  - ray start --address=$RAY_HEAD_IP:6379 --object-manager-port=8076\n```\n\nThen, run the following command to launch the Ray cluster with 10 nodes:\n\n```bash\nRAY_HEAD_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters \"Name=tag:Name,Values=my-ray-cluster-head\" --query \"Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicIpAddress\" --output text)\n\nray up --min-workers 0 --max-workers 10 config.yaml\n```\n\nThis command sets the minimum worker count to 0 and the maximum worker count to 10, allowing you to launch a Ray cluster with 10 nodes. Note that you need to replace `my-ray-cluster` with your desired cluster name and update the AWS CLI command accordingly to get the correct `RAY_HEAD_IP`.",

This allows you to modify the data and have the changes reflected across all workers.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` function to get the trial directory and save any outputs there, ensuring that each worker has its own separate working directory.\n\nIt is important to note that the behavior of changing the working directory can be disabled by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR=0` environment variable, which allows access to files in the original working directory. However, relative paths should be used for read-only purposes, and you must make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `ray.init()` function with the `runtime_env` parameter to specify a working directory for the entire Ray job, which will be uploaded to the cluster when the job is started.\n\nFor example, you can use the following code to create a Ray task with a specified working directory:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef f():\n    # The function will have its working directory changed to its node's\n    # local copy of /tmp/runtime_env_working_dir.\n    return open(\"hello.txt\").read()\n```\nAnd then use the following code to specify the working directory when initializing Ray:\n```\nray.init(runtime_env={\"working_dir\": \"/tmp/runtime_env_working_dir\"})\n```\nThis will ensure that the `hello.txt` file is available in the working directory of the remote task.",

For more details, please see the documentation of `Tuner.restore()`.\n\nOnce the experiment is restored, you can access the results and checkpoints by calling `Tuner.get_results()` to receive the `ResultGrid` object, and then proceeding as outlined in the Tune documentation.\n\nNote that if you ran your initial experiment with cloud checkpointing, you will need to download all the checkpoints to your local machine before you can analyze them.

Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.tune.trainable import Trainable\n\nclass MyTrainable(Trainable):\n    def setup(self, config):\n        self.actor = Actor.options(name=\"actor\", lifetime=\"detached\").remote()\n\n    def train(self):\n        # ... train ...\n        pass\n\n    def cleanup(self):\n        # Kill the Ray actor launched in the Trainable\n        ray.kill(self.actor)\n```\nFinally, if you need to kill a misbehaving actor, you can call `ray.kill()` on any handle to the actor, not just the original handle. If the actor has a maximum number of restarts set, you can also allow Ray to automatically restart the actor by passing `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill()`.",

You may also need to configure your firewall settings and network configuration to allow the Ray cluster to function properly.\n\nOnce the Ray cluster is up and running, you can connect to it by calling `ray.init()` in your Ray program. This will automatically connect to the Ray cluster running on the default port (10001). If the Ray cluster is running on a different port, you can specify the port number using the `--ray-client-server-port` argument when calling `ray.init()`.\n\nFor more information on managing Ray clusters, you can refer to the Ray documentation on cluster management.",

This could be due to insufficient resource allocation for the trainable function or other processes using most of the CPUs. It is also possible that the application is waiting for other resources such as GPUs to become available. To resolve this issue, you can try increasing the number of CPU slots reserved for the trainable function or limiting the number of concurrent Tune trials to ensure there are enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on. Additionally, you can check if other processes are using most of the CPUs and consider adjusting their resource allocation accordingly.",
            "reference_answer": "Your Ray tuner might be showing 'running' but CPU usage is almost 0% due to several reasons. It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup.

            "question": "How do I make the GPU available on my M1 laptop to ray?",
            "generated_answer": " To make the GPU available on your M1 laptop for Ray, you need to install Ray on a machine running Apple Silicon (such as an M1 Mac) using miniforge. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Install miniforge.\n2. Activate the miniforge environment.\n3. Install Ray as you normally would.\n\nTo use the GPU with Ray, you can define a Ray remote function with `num_gpus=1` and use TensorFlow or another external library that supports GPU acceleration. Here's an example:\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    # Use TensorFlow to utilize the GPU\n```\nNote that you will need to install the GPU version of TensorFlow for this to work. Also, keep in mind that if you are using fractional GPUs, it is your responsibility to ensure that multiple trials can share GPUs and there is enough memory to do so. Ray does not automatically handle this for you.\n\nTo request GPUs, you can use the `ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources` function to scale up GPU resources. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(bundles=[{\"GPU\": 1}] * 2)\n```\nAfter the nodes are scaled up, they will persist until the request is explicitly overridden. To remove the resource request, you can use the following program:\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(bundles=[])\n```\nThe GPU workers can then scale down.\n\nTo configure Ray pods for GPU usage, you need to specify `nvidia.com/gpu` resource limits and requests in the container fields of your RayCluster\u2019s headGroupSpec and/or workerGroupSpecs. Here's a config snippet for a RayCluster workerGroup of up to 5 GPU workers:\n```yaml\ngroupName: gpu-group\nreplicas: 0\nminReplicas: 0\nmaxReplicas: 5\n...\ntemplate:\n    spec:\n     ...\n     containers:\n      - name: ray-node\n        image: rayproject/ray-ml:2.6.3-gpu\n        ...\n        resources:\n         nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Optional, included just for documentation.\n         cpu: 3\n         memory: 50Gi\n        limits:\n         nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Required to use GPU.\n         cpu: 3\n```\nNote that using Nvidia GPUs requires specifying `nvidia.com/gpu` resource limits and requests in the container fields of your RayCluster\u2019s headGroupSpec and/or workerGroupSpecs.\n\nTo access the dashboard, use `ray[default]`, `ray[air]`, or other installation commands that include the Ray Dashboard component. When you start a single-node Ray Cluster on your laptop, access the dashboard with the URL that Ray prints when it initializes (the default URL is <http://localhost:8265>) or with the context object returned by `ray.init()`.\n\nTo wait for GPU availability, you can use `ray.tune.utils.wait_for_gpu` function. Here's an example:\n```python\nray.tune.utils.wait_for_gpu(gpu_id=0, target_util=0.01, retry=20, delay_s=5, gpu_memory_limit=None)\n```\nThis function checks if a given GPU has freed memory and requires `gputil` to be installed. It blocks until the GPU is completely free if `target_util` is set to 0.",

You can do this by downloading it from the provided link using wget, then running the downloaded script.

            "generated_answer": " To add a timeout for a Ray job, you can use the `timeout` parameter in the `ray.get()` function when retrieving the object reference of the remote function. If the function doesn't complete within the specified timeout, a `GetTimeoutError` will be raised.

However, this requires additional scripting and is not a built-in feature of Ray.\n\nNote that the `request_timeout_s` field in the `http_options` config is not related to Ray job timeouts, but rather sets the end-to-end timeout for HTTP requests in Ray Serve.",

For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

The node is still running, which means the problem is not a worker node failure but rather a failure in the health check process.\n\nThe context provided offers some insights into troubleshooting Ray issues, particularly those related to connecting to the head node (GCS). The most common cause of such issues is the worker node's inability to access the IP address or port of the head node. To debug this, you can use the 'ip route get' command on the worker node, targeting the head node's IP address.\n\nAnother possible cause for health check failures is a mismatch in Ray versions between the worker node and the head node. Ensure both nodes are running the same Ray version.\n\nLastly, there could be firewall settings preventing access to the head node. You can use tools like 'nmap' or 'nc' to check whether each port can be reached from a node.\n\nIn summary, to resolve the \"Health check failed for node\" issue:\n\n1. Check if the worker node can access the head node's IP address and port.\n2. Ensure both the worker node and the head node are running the same Ray version.\n3.

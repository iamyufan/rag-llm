            "generated_answer": " When using `map_batches`, you'll need to make sure your function is vectorized and can process a batch of rows at once, instead of individual rows. This is because `map_batches` applies the function to batches of data, which can be more efficient.\n\nIn your function, you should return a batch of rows, where each row is a dictionary. The batch should have the same size as the input batch.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use `map_batches`:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef process_batch(batch):\n    # process the entire batch of rows here\n    # for example, add a new column with the mean of a column\n    batch[\"new_column\"] = np.mean(batch[\"existing_column\"], axis=0)\n    return batch\n\nds = ds.map_batches(process_batch)\n```\nIn this example, `process_batch` takes a batch of rows as input, computes the mean of the `existing_column` for each row in the batch, and adds a new column `new_column` with the result.\n\nNote that the size of the batch should be small enough to fit into memory, to avoid out-of-memory situations. You can adjust the batch size by passing the `batch_size` argument to `map_batches`.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that `map_batches` is not applicable for unstructured data. If you're working with unstructured data, you should use Ray Data operations such as `map` instead.",
            "reference_answer": "You can specify the batch format in the map_batches() function. If you're working with NumPy ndarrays, your function should accept and return a dictionary of ndarrays. If you're working with pandas DataFrames, your function should accept and return a DataFrame.

It can take advantage of vectorized computation in ML frameworks like Tensorflow, PyTorch, and Scikit-Learn to evaluate multiple samples at once. Autoscaling in Ray Serve is achieved through Ray's inherent scalability and flexible scheduling support, such as fractional GPUs, enabling efficient resource utilization and low-cost serving of multiple machine learning models. Additionally, Ray Serve allows for model composition and flexible scaling by enabling multiple independent deployments to call into each other.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

            "generated_answer": " To get the address of a Ray node, you can use the `ray.nodes()` function, which returns information about the nodes in the Ray cluster. The information returned includes the `NodeManagerAddress` and `MetricsExportPort` for each node. You can combine these to get the address of the node. Here is an example:\n```\nimport ray\nray.init()\n\nnodes = ray.nodes()\nfor node in nodes:\n    node_address = node['NodeManagerAddress'] + ':' + str(node['MetricsExportPort'])\n    print(node_address)\n```\nThis will print the address for each node in the Ray cluster.\n\nIf you want to get the address of a specific node, you can use the `node_id` to filter the nodes returned by `ray.nodes()`. For example:\n```\nnode_id = '2691a0c1aed6f45e262b2372baf58871734332d7'\nnode = next((n for n in nodes if n['NodeID'] == node_id), None)\nif node:\n    node_address = node['NodeManagerAddress'] + ':' + str(node['MetricsExportPort'])\n    print(node_address)\n```\nThis will print the address of the node with the given `node_id`.\n\nNote that the address returned is the address of the metrics agent for the node, not the address of the node itself. If you want to get the IP address of the node, you can use the `NodeManagerHostname` field instead of the `NodeManagerAddress` field.\n\nAlso, the `MetricsExportPort` is used for the metrics agent, if you want to get the address of the object store, you can use the `ObjectManagerPort` field.\n\nFinally, the above examples are using the Python SDK, if you are using the CLI, you can use the `ray node get-address` command to get the address of a node.\n\nFor example:\n```\nray node get-address <node_id>\n```\nThis will return the address of the node with the given `node_id`.\n\nYou can also use the `ray node get-addresses` command to get the address of all nodes in the cluster.\n\nFor example:\n```\nray node get-addresses\n```\nThis will return the address of all nodes in the cluster.\n\nYou can also use the `ray node ls` command to get the information of all nodes in the cluster, including the `NodeManagerAddress` and `MetricsExportPort` fields.\n\nFor example:\n```\nray node ls\n```\nThis will return the information of all nodes in the cluster.\n\nYou can then use the `NodeManagerAddress` and `MetricsExportPort` fields to construct the address of the metrics agent for each node.\n\nI hope this helps!

            "generated_answer": " Ray's scheduling decisions are based on a task or actor's resource requirements and the available resources on a node. By default, Ray tasks use 1 logical CPU resource and Ray actors use 1 logical CPU for scheduling, and 0 logical CPU for running. If a task or actor requests more resources than available on a node, Ray will not schedule it on that node to avoid overloading the node's resources.\n\nHowever, Ray's resources are logical, not physical, meaning that specifying resource requirements does not impose limits on actual physical resource usage. It's the user's responsibility to ensure that tasks or actors use no more resources than specified via resource requirements.\n\nTherefore, if Ray is overloading a node with more tasks than the resources allow, it may be due to misconfiguration of resource requirements or exceeding the physical resource limits. In this case, reducing the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node by increasing the amount of resources requested by them can help prevent overloading the node's resources.",

            "question": "how to scatter actors across the cluster?",
            "generated_answer": " To scatter actors across a cluster, you can use the `ActorClass.remote()` method to create an instance of the actor on a remote worker process. The return value of this method is an actor handle that can be used to call the actor's methods. For example:\n```\n# Create the progress actor.\nprogress_actor = ProgressActor.remote(TOTAL_NUM_SAMPLES)\n```\nYou can also use the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` class to specify a fixed pool of actors to use for a computation. This can be useful if you have multiple tasks that need to wait on some condition or synchronize across tasks and actors on a cluster. For example:\n```\n# Set the ActorPool size to the number of GPUs in your cluster.\ncompute=ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy(size=2)\n```\nAdditionally, you can use the `ray.util.ActorPool` utility class to operate on a fixed pool of actors. This can be useful for managing a pool of actors and their resources. For example:\n```\n# The actor pool will have at least 2 workers and at most 8 workers.\nstrategy = ActorPoolStrategy(min_size=2, max_size=8)\n```\nIt's also a good idea to consider the number of CPUs in your cluster when setting the number of actors and the CPUs per actor. A common approach is to set the number of actors to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of CPUs in your cluster, and the CPUs per actor to the GCD. This can help ensure that the actors are evenly distributed across the cluster and that they have enough resources to perform their tasks. For example:\n```\n# Use 6 actors, each actor using 4 CPUs. 4 * 6 = 24 CPUs total.\nactors = [Actor.remote() for _ in range(6)]\nstrategy = ActorPoolStrategy(actors=actors, cpus_per_actor=4)\n```\nYou can then use the `map_batches()` method to transform batches with the actors in the pool. For example:\n```\n# Transform batches with the actors in the pool.\nds.map_batches(MyActor, compute=strategy).take()\n```\nThis will distribute the batches across the actors in the pool and apply the `MyActor` class to each batch. The results will be returned as a Ray Dataset.\n\nIn summary, to scatter actors across a cluster, you can use the `ActorClass.remote()` method to create instances of the actor on remote worker processes, and the `ray.data.ActorPoolStrategy` class to specify a fixed pool of actors to use for a computation. You can also use the `ray.util.ActorPool` utility class to manage a pool of actors and their resources.

This could be due to the node running out of memory or other system resources.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the issue may not necessarily be with TensorflowTrainer itself, but rather with the resources available on the worker node. It's possible that the workload is too large for the available resources, or that there is a memory leak in the code.\n\nFinally, you may want to consider adjusting the worker killing policy to avoid killing workers due to memory pressure. The memory monitor in Ray avoids infinite loops of task retries by ensuring at least one task is able to run for each caller on each node. If it is unable to ensure this, the workload will fail with an OOM error. However, this is only an issue for tasks, since the memory monitor will not indefinitely retry actors.

Head node failure: When the head node fails, the entire Ray cluster fails. This can be simulated by killing the head pod or the head node.\n2. Raylet failure: When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n3. Memory pressure: Workers can be killed due to memory pressure or low memory on the node.\n4. User action: The cluster can be terminated due to user action.\n5. Overloading the head node: The head node can be overloaded with too many simultaneous connections, causing worker nodes to fail to connect to the cluster.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, it is important to ensure that the head node is fault-tolerant, monitor and manage memory usage, and start worker nodes slowly to avoid overloading the head node.",

This can occur when application tasks or actors consume a large amount of heap space, causing the node to run out of memory. When this happens, the operating system will start killing worker or raylet processes, disrupting the application.

To use it, you can specify the desired configurations when creating a deployment or when initializing the Ray Serve application.\n\nFor example, you can use the `runtime_env` argument to set the runtime environment for your deployment, which allows you to specify environment variables, packages, and local files. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray import serve\n\nserve.deployment(\"my_deployment\",\n                runtime_env={\n                    \"env\": {\"VAR1\": \"value1\", \"VAR2\": \"value2\"},\n                    \"packages\": [\"package1\", \"package2\"],\n                    \"local_files\": [\"file1.txt\", \"file2.txt\"]\n                },\n                my_function)\n```\nIn this example, the `runtime_env` argument is used to set the environment variables `VAR1` and `VAR2`, install the packages `package1` and `package2`, and include the local files `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` in the runtime environment for the deployment `my_deployment`.\n\nYou can also use the `client()` function from the Ray Serve API to create a Ray Serve client with a specific namespace and runtime environment. Here's an example:\n```python\nfrom ray import serve\n\nclient = serve.client(namespace=\"my_namespace\", runtime_env={\n    \"env\": {\"VAR1\": \"value1\", \"VAR2\": \"value2\"},\n    \"packages\": [\"package1\", \"package2\"],\n    \"local_files\": [\"file1.txt\", \"file2.txt\"]\n})\n```\nIn this example, the `client()` function is used to create a Ray Serve client with the namespace `my_namespace` and the same runtime environment as in the previous example.\n\nNote that the `runtime_env` argument is optional, and you can omit it if you don't need to customize the runtime environment.",

You can use the user_config field to supply structured configuration for your deployment. You can pass arbitrary JSON serializable objects to the YAML configuration. Serve then applies it to all running and future deployment replicas. The application of user configuration does not restart the replica. This means you can use this field to dynamically adjust model weights and versions without restarting the cluster, adjust traffic splitting percentage for your model composition graph, configure any feature flag, A/B tests, and hyper-parameters for your deployments. To enable the user_config feature, you need to implement a reconfigure method that takes a JSON-serializable object (e.g., a Dictionary, List or String) as its only argument. If the user_config is set when the deployment is created (e.g., in the decorator or the Serve config file), this reconfigure method is called right after the deployment\u2019s __init__ method, and the user_config is passed in as an argument.

The value of the `memory` key should be a dictionary containing the memory limit in the format `{\"unit\": \"GB\", \"threshold\": limit}`, where `limit` is the desired memory limit in gigabytes. Here is an example:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    my_trainable,\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(stop={\"memory\": {\"unit\": \"GB\", \"threshold\": limit}}),\n)\n```\nThis will stop each trial when the memory usage exceeds the specified limit. Note that the memory limit is applied to the entire trial, not to individual tasks within the trial.\n\nIf you want to set a memory limit per task, you can use the `resources_per_task` argument in the `train.RunConfig` constructor to specify the maximum amount of memory that each task is allowed to use. For example:\n```\nfrom ray import train, tune\n\ntuner = tune.Tuner(\n    my_trainable,\n    run_config=train.RunConfig(resources_per_task={\"cpu\": 1, \"memory\": limit}),\n)\n```\nThis will limit the memory usage of each task to the specified limit.

Initialize a WandB run at the beginning of your script: `wandb.init(project=\"your-project-name\")`\n3. Wrap your `AccelerateTrainer` with a custom trainer class that logs relevant metrics to WandB after each training step or epoch. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport transformers\nfrom accelerate import Accelerator\nfrom ray import tune\nfrom ray.train.trainer import Trainer\n\nclass WandBTrainer(Trainer):\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        self.accelerator = Accelerator()\n\n    def train_step(self, batch):\n        inputs = self.accelerator.prepare(batch)\n        outputs = self.model(**inputs)\n        loss = outputs.loss\n        logits = outputs.logits\n        labels = inputs[\"labels\"]\n        loss = loss.mean()  # Mean over all GPUs\n        logits = logits.mean()  # Mean over all GPUs\n        preds = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1)\n        acc = (preds == labels).float().mean()\n\n        # Log metrics to WandB\n        wandb.log({\"train_loss\": loss, \"train_accuracy\": acc})\n\n        return loss\n```\n\n4. Use your custom `WandBTrainer` class with Ray Train:\n\n```python\ntune.run(\n    WandBTrainer,\n    config={\n        # Your training configs here\n    },\n)\n```\n\nThis example assumes that you have already set up a WandB project and replaced \"your-project-name\" with the name of your project. The `WandBTrainer` class logs the training loss and accuracy to WandB after each training step. You can modify the logging frequency and metrics as needed.",

Implement the `setup` and `train_loop` methods in your custom Ray Trainable class.\n4. Use `ray.train.run` to launch the training.\n\nHere's an example of how you can define your custom Ray Trainable class:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.train import Checkpoint, CheckpointConfig, RunConfig, ScalingConfig\nfrom ray.train.torch import TorchTrainer\n\nclass KerasTrainer(TorchTrainer):\n    def __init__(self, model_definition, num_workers=4, use_gpu=False):\n        super().__init__(num_workers=num_workers, use_gpu=use_gpu)\n        self.model_definition = model_definition\n\n    def setup(self, config):\n        from tensorflow import keras\n\n        # Create the model\n        self.model = self.model_definition()\n\n    def train_loop(self, config, data_loader):\n        for batch in data_loader:\n            # Perform training on the batch\n            self.model.train_on_batch(batch[0], batch[1])\n\n# Define your Keras model\ndef create_model():\n    model = keras.Sequential([\n        keras.layers.Dense(32, input_shape=(1,), activation='relu'),\n        keras.layers.Dense(1)\n    ])\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse')\n    return model\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Create a Ray Dataset\nds = ray.data.from_items([{\"x\": [x], \"y\": [2 * x]} for x in range(200)])\n\n# Preprocess your Ray Dataset\nds = ds.map_batches(increment)\n\n# Define the train config\ntrain_config = RunConfig(\n    checkpoint_config=CheckpointConfig(\n        num_to_keep=3\n    ),\n    scaling_config=ScalingConfig(\n        num_workers=4,\n        use_gpu=False\n    )\n)\n\n# Create the KerasTrainer instance\ntrainer = KerasTrainer(create_model, num_workers=4, use_gpu=False)\n\n# Run the training\nresult = trainer.train(train_config, ds.train_shuffle_split())\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use Ray to distribute training for a custom Keras neural net.

            "generated_answer": " To use `ray.put` and `ray.get`, you need to understand that these functions are used to store and retrieve objects in Ray's object store.\n\n`ray.put(value)` is used to store an object in the object store and returns an object reference (`ObjectRef`). This object reference can be used to pass the object as an argument to any remote function or method call.\n\n`ray.get(object_refs)` is used to return an object or list of objects from the object ID or list of object IDs. This is a synchronous (i.e., blocking) operation.\n\nHere's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Put an object in the object store\nobj_ref = ray.put(\"hello world\")\n\n# Get the object from the object store\nobj = ray.get(obj_ref)\n\n# Print the object\nprint(obj)\n```\nIn this example, we first initialize Ray using `ray.init()`. Then, we store the string \"hello world\" in the object store using `ray.put()` and get an object reference. We then use `ray.get()` to retrieve the object from the object store and print it.\n\nIt's important to note that calling `ray.get()` unnecessarily can harm performance, so it's best practice to wait as long as possible before calling `ray.get()` or even design your program to avoid having to call `ray.get()` at all. Instead, you can work with object references directly.\n\nAdditionally, you should avoid passing large arguments to remote task or method calls repeatedly. Instead, use `ray.put()` to create a copy of the object in the object store and pass the object reference to tasks. This way, you can ensure that all tasks use the same copy of the argument, which is faster and uses less object store memory.",
            "reference_answer": "To use ray.put and ray.get in Python, you first import the ray module. You can use ray.put() to store a value in the object store, which returns an object reference. You can then use ray.get() to fetch the result of a remote object from the object reference. If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the get call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory. Otherwise, the object data is deserialized into a Python object. You can also set a timeout to return early from a get that's blocking for too long. Similar methods are used in Java and C++, with slight syntax differences.",

            "generated_answer": " To perform an all\\_reduce operation among a list of actors, you can use the Ray's actor system to create a distributed computation pattern. However, Ray does not provide an all\\_reduce function out-of-the-box for actors. Instead, you can implement a custom reduction logic using Ray's remote functions and actor system.\n\nHere's a high-level outline of how you can implement an all\\_reduce operation using Ray:\n\n1. Create a remote function that performs the reduction operation.\n2. Use Ray's `put()` function to store the initial values on the object store.\n3. Use Ray's `get()` function to retrieve the final reduced value.\n\nHere's a simple example of implementing an all\\_reduce using a sum reduction function:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Reducer:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.value = 0\n\n    def add(self, value):\n        self.value += value\n\n    def get_value(self):\n        return self.value\n\n# Initialize reducers\nreducers = [Reducer.remote() for _ in range(num_actors)]\n\n# Perform the reduction\nfor i in range(num_iterations):\n    for reducer_id, reducer in enumerate(reducers):\n        value = get_value_from_actor(reducer_id)  # Fetch the value from the actor\n        ray.get(reducer.add.remote(value))  # Perform the reduction\n\n# Get the final reduced value\nfinal_value = ray.get(reducers[0].get_value.remote())\n```\n\nReplace `num_actors` and `num_iterations` with the appropriate values for your use case. The `get_value_from_actor()` function should fetch the value from the actor, which can be implemented using Ray's `get()` function.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a simple example and you might need to adapt it to your specific use case. For instance, you can replace the `add()` function with a more complex reduction logic depending on your requirements.",
            "reference_answer": "To perform an all_reduce operation among a list of actors, you can use the 'apply_reduce' function provided in the context. This function takes in the results from each actor, and reduces them into a single output by adding up all word occurrences. The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine. The final result is a dictionary of word counts, which is then sorted and printed.",

Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible.\n3. Create a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster`.\n4. Be careful when running tests in parallel.\n\nHere's an example of how to set up a test case with a shared Ray cluster:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def test_my_ray_code(self):\n        # Test your Ray code here.\n        pass\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the comment with your actual test code. The `setUp` method is called before each test method, ensuring a fresh Ray cluster for every test.\n\nAdditionally, if your code contains non-deterministic output, you can use the provided \"testcode\" and \"testoutput\" blocks to display a sample output or replace problematic sections with ellipses.",
            "reference_answer": "To write unit tests for Ray code, you can use the unittest module in Python. You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

Instead, fetch the results of remotely executed functions using `ray.get()` only for the final result. If you call `ray.get()` unnecessarily for intermediate steps, it can harm performance. Work with object references directly and call `ray.get()` at the end to get the final result.\n\nIn your specific case, you should separate the call to `ray.get()` from the call to the remote functions. Spawn all remote functions before waiting for the results, so they can run in parallel in the background. Pass a list of object references to `ray.get()` instead of calling it one by one, to wait for all tasks to finish.\n\nHere's an example of how to properly use `ray.get()`:\n\n```python\n# Spawn remote functions\nobject_refs = [function.remote() for function in function_list]\n\n# Wait for all tasks to finish\nresults = ray.get(object_refs)\n```",

            "generated_answer": " The `ray.actor.exit_actor()` function can be used to manually terminate a Ray actor from within one of the actor methods. This will kill the actor process and release associated resources. Here is an example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def exit(self):\n        ray.actor.exit_actor()\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nactor.exit.remote()\n```\n\nHowever, it is generally not necessary to manually terminate actors, as they are automatically garbage collected. The object ref resulting from the task can be waited on to wait for the actor to exit.\n\nTo forcefully terminate an actor, you can use the `ray.kill()` function. This should be reserved for cases where an actor is unexpectedly hanging or leaking resources, and for detached actors, which must be manually destroyed. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\n\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\n\nNote that this will not go through the normal Python sys.exit teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `atexit` will not be called.\n\nGarbage collection for actors has not been implemented yet, so this is currently the only way to terminate an actor gracefully. The object ref resulting from the task can be waited on to wait for the actor to exit. This method of termination waits until any previously submitted tasks finish executing and then exits the process gracefully with sys.exit. You can see the actor is dead as a result of the user's `exit_actor()` call by using the `ray list actors --detail` command.\n\nIn C++, you can use the `actor_handle.Kill()` function to forcefully terminate an actor. This will cause the actor to immediately exit its process, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail with a RayActorError. If you would like Ray to automatically restart the actor, make sure to set a nonzero max\\_restarts in the `@ray.remote` options for the actor, then pass the flag `no_restart=False` to `ray.kill`. For named and detached actors, calling `ray.kill` on an actor handle destroys the actor and allows the name to be reused.",

However, this does not force GPU tasks to release resources after finishing.

This can be useful for tasks that only use GPUs or other resources, and you don't want to waste CPU resources on them.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that setting `num_cpus=0` may not necessarily result in lower resource usage or better performance, as other factors such as memory usage, I/O, and network traffic can also affect resource utilization and performance.",

However, Ray does not directly support specifying a custom PEM file for SSH. Instead, you can copy your custom PEM file to the head node and worker nodes using the `file_mounts` configuration. Here's an example:\n\n1. Copy your custom PEM file to the local machine (the machine where you run the Ray cluster launch command) at a known location, e.g., `~/my-custom-pem.pem`.\n2. Modify the `file_mounts` configuration in the Ray cluster launch configuration to include the custom PEM file:\n\n   ```\n   file_mounts: {\n     \"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\": \"~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\",\n     \"~/my-custom-pem.pem\": \"~/my-custom-pem.pem\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Ensure that the `~/.ssh/config` file on the local machine is configured to use the custom PEM file for SSH connections to the worker nodes. For example:\n\n   ```\n   Host *\n     IdentityFile ~/my-custom-pem.pem\n   ```\n\n4. After launching the Ray cluster, the custom PEM file will be available on the head node and worker nodes at `~/my-custom-pem.pem`. You can then use it for SSH connections to the worker nodes as needed.\n\nNote that this approach only copies the custom PEM file to the head node and worker nodes. You will still need to configure the SSH settings on the local machine and worker nodes to use the custom PEM file for SSH connections.",

In your case, it's taking up a significant amount of memory on the head node. This is normal for a large cluster, as all worker nodes connect to the head node, adding many entries to the ARP table. To accommodate this, ensure that the ARP cache size is large enough.\n\nIn Ubuntu, you can tune the ARP cache size in /etc/sysctl.conf by increasing the values of net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh1 through net.ipv4.neigh.default.gc_thresh3. For more information, refer to the OS manual.\n\nAdditionally, when configuring the head node for a large cluster, consider using a machine with 8 CPUs and 32 GB memory as a starting point.

If you suspect that the issue might be related to autoscaling, you can check the autoscaler monitor log by running `cat /tmp/ray/session_latest/logs/monitor.*`.\n3. If you're using Kubernetes to launch your Ray cluster, you can check for errors via `kubectl describe pod <pod_name>` and ensure that your Docker resource limits are set high enough.\n4.

If you're still having trouble, you can try restarting the cluster by running `ray up` again. This will restart all Ray services even if there are no config changes.\n\nIn some cases, the issue might be due to resource contention, where the requested resources cannot be scheduled due to all cluster resources being claimed by actors.

However, note that `map_batches()` does not shuffle the data by default. The warning about shuffling is related to other operations like `map()`, `flat_map()`, and `filter()`. Here's how to set the flag:\n\n```python\nctx = ray.data.DataContext.get_current()\nctx.use_push_based_shuffle = True\n```\n\nIf you want to shuffle the data during training, consider randomizing each block of your dataset and enabling local shuffling during iteration. This can be done using `randomize_block_order` and specifying a `local_shuffle_buffer_size` when calling `iter_batches()` or `iter_torch_batches()`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nds = ray.data.read_text(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/sms_spam_collection_subset.txt\")\nds = ds.randomize_block_order()\n```\n\nThen, during training:\n\n```python\nfor batch in ds.iter_batches(batch_size=128, local_shuffle_buffer_size=100_000):\n    # Process the batch\n    pass\n```\n\nThis will shuffle the data within each block and provide better performance compared to shuffling all rows.",

However, you can use the `ray.util.state.get_node` function to get the node state by specifying the node ID. To get the current node ID for the worker or driver, you can use the `ray.runtime_context.RuntimeContext.get_node_id` function, which returns the node ID in hex format. Note that the API `ray.runtime_context.RuntimeContext.node_id` is deprecated and will be removed in future Ray releases.\n\nHere's an example of how to use these functions in Python:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.util.state import get_node\nfrom ray.runtime_context import RuntimeContext\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Get the current node ID for this worker or driver\nnode_id = RuntimeContext.get_node_id()\n\n# Get the node state by specifying the node ID\nnode_state = get_node(node_id)\n\n# Print the node state\nprint(node_state)\n```\n\nTo determine if the node is the head node, you can check the `is_head_node` attribute of the `NodeState` object returned by the `get_node` function.\n\nIf you want to use the REST API, you can make an HTTP request to the Ray API server's `/node/info` endpoint, which returns information about all the nodes in the cluster, including the head node. You can then parse the response to extract the information you need. Note that this requires the Ray API server to be running and accessible over HTTP.\n\nHere's an example of how to make the HTTP request using the `requests` library in Python:\n\n```python\nimport requests\n\n# Make the HTTP request to the Ray API server's /node/info endpoint\nresponse = requests.get('http://localhost:8265/node/info')\n\n# Parse the response to extract the information about the nodes\nnodes = response.json()['nodes']\nhead_node = next((node for node in nodes if node['is_head_node']), None)\n\n# Print the information about the head node\nprint(head_node)\n```\n\nNote that the URL for the Ray API server may be different in your setup.

Additionally, there might be no available CPUs in the Ray cluster as other processes or Tune trials might be using them. To ensure there are enough free CPUs for Ray Data to run on, you can limit the number of concurrent Tune trials with the max\\_concurrent\\_trials Tune option.",
            "reference_answer": "Your Ray tuner might be showing 'running' but CPU usage is almost 0% due to several reasons. It could be because the number of cores Ray is using is less than the tasks it needs to perform. It could also be due to the tasks being very small or having variable durations. Another reason could be that all of your tasks are attempting to use all of the cores on the machine, leading to contention and preventing your application from achieving a speedup. This is common with some versions of numpy. To avoid contention, set an environment variable like MKL_NUM_THREADS to 1.",

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

Tasks that use more than 1 CPU may experience slowdown due to interference from concurrent ones. Tasks or actors that use more than their proportionate share of memory may overload a node and cause issues like OOM. To manage this, the number of concurrently running tasks or actors on each node can be reduced by increasing the amount of resources requested by them.",

You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).

It has a CLI, API, and utilities for scheduling, runtime environment configuration, and debugging. Ray Core is the foundation of Ray's unified compute framework and enables the development of scalable, distributed systems. It can be used for parallelizing functions, scaling ML workloads, and integrating tooling from the broader ML ecosystem.",
            "reference_answer": "Ray Core provides a small number of core primitives for building and scaling distributed applications. It allows you to turn your functions and classes into Ray tasks and actors, and work with Ray objects. You can run functions as remote tasks in the cluster by decorating your function with @ray.remote and calling the function with .remote(). Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state. Ray stores task and actor call results in its distributed object store, returning object references that can be later retrieved.",

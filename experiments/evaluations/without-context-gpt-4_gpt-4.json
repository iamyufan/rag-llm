You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).

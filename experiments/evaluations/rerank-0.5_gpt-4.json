It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs. It's well-suited for ETL, machine learning, and graph processing tasks.\n\nRay is a distributed execution engine that focuses on scaling and simplifying machine learning and AI applications. It's designed to be general-purpose and supports a wide range of use cases, including machine learning, reinforcement learning, and large-scale data processing. Ray's unique feature is its ability to seamlessly mix and execute tasks written in different programming languages, such as Python, Java, and C++.\n\nDask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing, built with the Python ecosystem in mind. It's designed to integrate with Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy, making it easy to scale data science workloads. Dask is often used for distributed data processing, machine learning, and scientific computing tasks.\n\nWhen comparing Spark, Ray, and Dask, it's essential to consider the specific requirements of your use case.

Write your LLM application as a single Python module, including prompt preprocessing, vector database lookups, LLM API calls, and response validation. Ray Serve supports any arbitrary Python code, enabling rapid development and easy testing.\n2. Use the `@serve.deployment` decorator to define a deployment for your Python class or function. This will create a deployment that contains the business logic or ML model to handle incoming requests.\n3. Deploy your Ray Serve LLM application to production using the Ray Serve CLI. You can deploy to a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n4. Ray Serve allows for independent autoscaling of each application step, efficiently accommodating user traffic without wasting resources.\n5. Utilize Ray Serve features for batching and integration to improve the performance of your LLM applications.\n\nRefer to the provided context for more information on deploying Ray Serve config files, updating applications, and deploying to remote clusters.",

This can be caused by killing the head pod or the head node.\n2. Raylet failure: When a raylet process fails, the corresponding node is marked as dead and treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n3. Worker node failure: A worker node failure can be simulated in a Kubernetes cluster by looking at the nodes and pods running in the cluster and killing one of the pods.\n4. Memory pressure: Workers can be killed due to memory pressure, causing the node to run low on memory.\n5. Overloading the head node: Overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can cause the worker nodes to fail to connect to the cluster.\n6. Cluster termination: The cluster can be terminated due to user action, causing all nodes to die.\n\nTo tolerate head node failures, it is necessary to make the GCS fault-tolerant so that when a new head node is started, all the cluster-level data is still available. Node fault tolerance can be improved by setting placement strategies that pack bundles into as few nodes as possible or spread them across distinct nodes as evenly as possible.",

Retrieval of the actor from any job in the Ray cluster, which is useful if you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it or if you are trying to access an actor launched by another driver.\n2. Get-Or-Create option, which allows creating an actor only if it doesn\u2019t exist, and if it does, a handle to the actor will be returned, and the arguments will be ignored.\n3. Specifying a namespace for a named actor while creating it, which allows the actor to belong to the specified namespace, no matter what namespace of the current job is.\n4. Decoupling actor lifetimes from the job, allowing an actor to persist even after the driver process of the job exits, which is useful for long-running services.",

This will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is currently in mid-execution. If you want to force-exit the worker, you can pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel()`. Note that Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\n\nThis cancellation approach aligns with the standards presented in asyncio task cancellation. Note that asyncio.Task won\u2019t be interrupted in the middle of execution if you don\u2019t await within the async function. Ray attempts to cancel Tasks on a best-effort basis, meaning cancellation isn\u2019t always guaranteed. You can check if a Task was successfully cancelled using `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`.\n\nFor Actor Tasks, if the specified Task is pending execution, it is cancelled and not executed. If the Task is currently executing, the behavior depends on the execution model of an Actor. If it is a regular Actor or a threaded Actor, the execution isn\u2019t cancelled. Actor Tasks cannot be interrupted because Actors have states. If it is an async Actor, Ray cancels a asyncio.Task. The semantic of cancellation is equivalent to asyncio\u2019s cancellation. If the Task has finished, nothing happens. Only `force=False` is allowed for an Actor Task. Otherwise, it raises ValueError. Use `ray.kill(actor)` instead to kill an Actor.\n\nTo cancel an Actor Task, you can also call `ray.cancel()` on the returned Object Ref.\n\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    async def f(self):\n        try:\n            await asyncio.sleep(5)\n        except asyncio.CancelledError:\n            print(\"Actor task canceled.\")\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nref = actor.f.remote()\n\n# Wait until task is scheduled.\ntime.sleep(1)\nray.cancel(ref)\n```",

However, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.

This reference can then be used to retrieve the object using `ray.get(object_ref)`.\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Put an object in the object store\nobj_ref = ray.put(\"Hello, Ray!\")\n\n# Get the object from the object store\nobj = ray.get(obj_ref)\nprint(obj)  # Output: 'Hello, Ray!'\n```\n\nIn this example, we first initialize Ray using `ray.init()`. Then, we store a string \"Hello, Ray!\" in the object store using `ray.put()`, which returns an object reference. Finally, we retrieve the object from the object store using `ray.get()` and print it.\n\nNote that `ray.get()` is a blocking operation, meaning that it will wait until the object is available in the object store before returning. If you want to wait for the object to be available without retrieving it, you can use `ray.wait()`.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that unnecessary use of `ray.get()` can harm performance, as it requires transferring objects between nodes.

If the object is a numpy array or a collection of numpy arrays, the get call is zero-copy and returns arrays backed by shared object store memory.

Load the data using Ray Data's `read_files` method, which supports reading data from various file formats.\n2. Preprocess the data using Ray Data's preprocessors, which are a higher-level API for transforming tabular and structured data. These preprocessors can be applied to the dataset before passing it into a Trainer.\n3. If the preprocessed dataset is small enough to fit in Ray's object store memory, materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray's object store by calling `materialize()` on the preprocessed dataset. This will compute the entire preprocessed dataset and pin it in the Ray object store memory, avoiding re-running preprocessing operations when iterating over the dataset repeatedly.\n\nHere's an example of how to use Ray Data to preprocess a tabular dataset:\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data.preprocessors import MinMaxScaler\nfrom ray.train.xgboost import XGBoostTrainer\nfrom ray.train import ScalingConfig\n\n# Load data from files\ndata = ray.data.read_files(\"my_data_files/*.csv\")\n\n# Preprocess the data\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\ndata = data.map_batches(scaler, batch_format=\"pandas\")\n\n# Materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray's object store (if it fits in memory)\nif data.count() < 0.3 * ray.cluster_resources()[\"memory_total_mb\"]:\n    data = data.materialize()\n\n# Train a model using the preprocessed dataset\ntrainer = XGBoostTrainer(...)\nscaling_config = ScalingConfig(num_workers=...)\nray.train.run(trainer, config=scaling_config, dataset=data)\n```\nNote that if the preprocessed dataset is too large to fit into Ray's object store memory, it's not recommended to materialize it, as it will decrease performance due to data spillage to and from disk. In this case, you can consider using Ray's streaming Dataset primitive to stream the data from CPU preprocessing tasks to GPU inferencing or training tasks, allowing you to utilize both sets of resources concurrently.",

Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\nFirst, define a remote function that performs the allreduce operation on a tensor using a GPU:\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\nclass Worker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.buffer = cupy.ones((10,), dtype=cupy.float32)\n\n    def compute(self):\n        col.allreduce(self.buffer, \"default\")\n        return self.buffer\n```\nThen, create multiple actors and invoke the `compute` function remotely:\n```python\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\n\nray.get([A.compute.remote(), B.compute.remote()])\n```\nThis will perform an allreduce operation on the `buffer` attribute of each actor. Note that you can use `col.allreduce` with any tensor that is on a GPU.\n\nTo perform an allreduce operation on a list of tensors, you can use the `ray.util.collective.allreduce` function directly:\n```python\ntensor_list = [tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]\ngroup_name = \"my_group\"\n\nray.util.collective.allreduce(tensor_list, group_name)\n```\nThis will perform an allreduce operation on each tensor in `tensor_list` and store the results in the same list. The `group_name` parameter specifies the collective group to perform the allreduce operation in. By default, all processes belong to the \"default\" group.",
            "reference_answer": "To perform an all_reduce operation among a list of actors, you can use the 'apply_reduce' function provided in the context.

The 'apply_reduce' function is used in the reduce phase of the MapReduce process, where the j-th return value from each mapper is sent to the j-th reducer. This is done by passing references to the data using Ray objects, which allows for the handling of large datasets that don\u2019t fit on one machine.

Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible to avoid the overhead of creating a new cluster for each test. You can do this by calling `ray.init()` before running any tests and `ray.shutdown()` after all tests have finished.\n2. Fix the resource quantity with `ray.init(num_cpus=...)` to ensure that each test has consistent resources.\n3. Consider creating a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` for more complex tests.\n4. Be careful when running tests in parallel to avoid race conditions.\n\nHere is an example of how to set up a basic test case for Ray:\n\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n\n    def test_my_ray_code(self):\n        # Test your Ray code here.\n        pass\n```\n\nYou can then run your tests using a test runner like `unittest.main()`.\n\nNote that if you are testing Tune specifically, you can follow the instructions in the Tune documentation for setting up and running tests.",

Also, subsequent calls to get the actor handle via `ray.get_actor()` will fail.\n\nIf you want to terminate the actor gracefully, you can wait for any previously submitted tasks to finish executing and then exit the process gracefully with `sys.exit()`. However, this is not currently implemented in Ray for C++ actors.\n\nFor non-detached actors, Ray will automatically terminate them when all actor handles to them in Python are deleted. This will cause them to complete any outstanding work and then shut down. If you want to kill actors immediately, you can also call `ray.kill(actor)`.",

            "generated_answer": " To add logging inside an actor in Ray, you can define a log method within the actor class and use the logging library to add log messages. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        self.logger.info(msg)\n\n    def some_method(self):\n        # some code here\n        self.log(\"Log message from inside the actor\")\n```\n\nThen, you can call the log method from a remote function:\n\n```python\nactor = MyActor.remote()\nray.get(actor.log.remote(\"A log message for an actor.\"))\n```\n\nThis will add log messages to the driver output by default. If you want to customize the logging prefixes for actor logs, you can define the `__repr__` method for the actor class to replace the actor name with a custom representation. For example:\n\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def __init__(self, index):\n        self.index = index\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f\"MyActor(index={self.index})\"\n\n    def log(self, msg):\n        self.logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        self.logger.info(msg)\n\n# Create 5 actors with custom indexes\nactors = [MyActor.remote(i) for i in range(5)]\n\n# Call the log method for each actor\nfor actor in actors:\n    ray.get(actor.log.remote(f\"Log message from actor {actor}\"))\n```\n\nThis will add log messages with custom prefixes to distinguish between log messages from different actors.",

Note that this will also enable debug logs for all Ray libraries, so you may see a lot of output. You can customize the logging configuration further by specifying the appropriate logger name for each Ray library.\n\nIf you want to disable logs being copied to the driver in large-scale runs, you can set `log_to_driver=False` in `ray.init()`.\n\nFor application logs, you can use Python loggers to format and structure your logs.

Ray memory monitor also periodically prints the aggregated out-of-memory killer summary to Ray drivers.\n\nYou can use the `ray memory` command to help track down what ObjectRef references are in scope and may be causing an ObjectStoreFullError. Running `ray memory` from the command line while a Ray application is running will give you a dump of all of the ObjectRef references that are currently held by the driver, actors, and tasks in the cluster.\n\nYou can also refer to the documentation on debugging memory issues and known problems: <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/memory-debugging.html>",

For example:\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef my_custom_module():\n    # Define the custom module here\n    def some_function():\n        # Implementation of the function\n        pass\n    return some_function\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyActor:\n    def do_something(self):\n        # Call the custom module as a task\n        custom_module = ray.get(my_custom_module.remote())\n        result = custom_module().some_function()\n        return result\n```\nThis way, you can use the custom module in your Actor class by calling it as a task.\n\nNote that in both cases, the custom module will be transferred to the worker nodes that execute the Actor methods, so it will be available on those nodes.\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the Ray documentation on tasks and actors:\n\n* Tasks: <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tasks.html>\n* Actors: <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/actors.html>",

            "generated_answer": " Based on the context provided, it seems like you are trying to view `log.info` messages in the Ray dashboard's Logs view. However, you are unable to see them.\n\nThere are a few reasons why this might be the case:\n\n1. **Driver logs are not captured for Ray Jobs submitted via Jobs API:** If you are using the Ray Jobs API to submit your Ray application, then the Driver logs are only captured if you submit the job via the Jobs API. If you are running the Ray Driver on the Head node directly or connecting via Ray Client, then the Driver logs are not accessible from the Dashboard. In this case, you can view the Driver logs in your terminal or Jupyter Notebook output.\n2. **Logs are not being written to the default logging directory:** By default, Ray writes logs to files in the directory `/tmp/ray/session_*/logs` on each Ray node's file system. If your logs are not being written to this directory, then they will not be visible in the Ray dashboard's Logs view. You can check the logging directory on each Ray node to see if your logs are being written there.\n3. **Log rotation configuration:** Ray has a log rotation configuration that might be causing your logs to be rotated or deleted before you have a chance to view them in the Ray dashboard's Logs view. You can check the log rotation configuration to see if this is the case.\n\nIf none of these reasons seem to be the cause of the issue, then you can try using the Ray log APIs to retrieve your logs directly. The `ray.util.state.list_logs()` function can be used to list the log files available, and the `ray.util.state.get_log()` function can be used to retrieve a log file based on its name or some entities' IDs (such as the process ID, actor ID, or task ID).\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `get_log()` function to retrieve the logs for a specific actor:\n```python\nfrom ray.util.state import get_log\n\n# Get the actor ID\nactor_id = <ACTOR_ID>\n\n# Get the log lines for the actor\nfor line in get_log(actor_id=actor_id):\n    print(line)\n```\nI hope this helps!

To expose the dashboard outside the cluster, you can either set up ingress or use port-forwarding.\n\nIt is important to note that for security purposes, you should not expose the Ray Dashboard publicly without proper authentication in place.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, you may want to check the Ray Dashboard configurations, which may differ depending on how you launch Ray clusters.

This allows you to modify the data and have the changes reflected across all nodes.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` function to get the trial directory, and then use relative paths to access and modify files within that directory.\n\nNote that if you want to use relative paths to access files in the original working directory, you can disable the behavior of changing the working directory by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR=0` environment variable. However, you should use relative paths for read-only purposes and ensure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `ray.put()` and `ray.get()` to update a file in the working directory:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n# Initialize Ray\nray.init()\n\n# Write some data to a file in the working directory\nwith open(\"my_file.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n    f.write(\"Hello, Ray!\")\n\n# Put the file in the object store\nray.put(\"my_file.txt\")\n\n# Modify the data in the file\ndata = ray.get(\"my_file.txt\")\nmodified_data = data.replace(\"Hello, Ray!\", \"Updated: Hello, Ray!\")\n\n# Write the modified data back to the file in the object store\nray.put(modified_data, \"my_file.txt\")\n\n# Get the updated file from the object store\nupdated_file = ray.get(\"my_file.txt\")\nprint(updated_file)\n```\nThis will print:\n```\nUpdated: Hello, Ray!\n```\nNote that this example assumes that the file `my_file.txt` exists in the working directory when the script is run. If the file does not exist, you will need to create it using `ray.put()` before modifying it.",

Set the `RAY_JEMALLOC_CONF` environment variable to the MALLOC\\_CONF of Jemalloc, with the desired configuration options.\n4.

This command displays the node status, resource usage, and information about pending and failed nodes. Additionally, you can check the Ray logs with `kubectl logs ${RAYCLUSTER_HEAD_POD}` to see if there are any errors or warnings related to the pending nodes.\n\nIf the pending nodes are due to insufficient resources, you can try increasing the resources available to the Ray cluster or reducing the number of actors or Tune trials. If the pending nodes are due to a bad state of the Ray cluster, you can try restarting the cluster with `ray up --restart-only`.\n\nYou can also use the `wait_for_nodes` function to wait for all nodes to join the cluster before starting your program. This function checks the number of nodes in the cluster every second and waits until the expected number of nodes have joined. Here is an example usage of the `wait_for_nodes` function:\n```python\nimport time\nimport sys\n\ndef wait_for_nodes(expected):\n    # Wait for all nodes to join the cluster.\n    while True:\n        num_nodes = len(ray.nodes())\n        if num_nodes < expected:\n            print(\n                \"{} nodes have joined so far, waiting for {} more.\".format(\n                    num_nodes, expected - num_nodes\n                )\n            )\n            sys.stdout.flush()\n            time.sleep(1)\n        else:\n            break\n\ndef main():\n    wait_for_nodes(4)\n    # Your program code here.\n```\nThis function can be useful to ensure that all nodes have joined the cluster before starting your program.",

For more details, please see the documentation of `Tuner.restore()`.\n\nOnce the experiment is restored, you can access the results and checkpoints by calling `Tuner.get_results()` to receive the `ResultGrid` object, and then proceeding as outlined in the Tune documentation.\n\nNote that if you ran your initial experiment with cloud checkpointing, you will need to download all the checkpoints to your local machine before you can analyze them.

Instead, you should re-create the task and call `ray.get()` on its new object reference. Here's an example using the `retrieve_task` function from the context:\n\n```python\n# Create a new task reference\nnew_ref = retrieve_task.remote(item, db)\n\n# Call ray.get() on the new reference to execute the task\nresult = ray.get(new_ref)\n```\n\nKeep in mind that canceled tasks aren't retried by default. If you want to retry a task upon exceptions thrown by application code, you can set the `retry_exceptions` argument to `True` when defining the remote function:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(retry_exceptions=True)\ndef retrieve_task(item, db):\n    time.sleep(item / 10.)\n    return item, db[item]\n```\n\nNow, if an exception occurs during the execution of the task, Ray will automatically retry the task until it succeeds or the maximum number of retries is exceeded.",

            "generated_answer": " To make the GPU available on your M1 laptop for Ray, you need to install Ray on a machine running Apple Silicon (such as M1 macs) using miniforge. However, multi-node clusters are currently untested on M1 Macs. Here are the steps to install Ray on an M1 Mac:\n\n1. Install miniforge by running the following command in the terminal:\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh\nbash Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh\nrm Miniforge3-MacOSX-arm64.sh # Cleanup.\n```\n2. Ensure you\u2019re using the miniforge environment by running the following commands:\n```bash\nsource ~/.bash_profile\nconda activate\n```\n3. Install Ray as you normally would by running the following command:\n```\npip install ray\n```\n\nTo use the GPU with Ray, you can define a Ray remote function with `num_gpus=1` and use external libraries like TensorFlow to make use of the GPU. Here is an example:\n\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    print(\"ray.get_gpu_ids(): {}\".format(ray.get_gpu_ids()))\n    print(\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: {}\".format(os.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"]))\n```\n\nNote that if you are using fractional GPUs, it is your responsibility to make sure multiple trials can share GPUs and there is enough memory to do so. Ray does not automatically handle this for you. If you want to use multiple GPUs per trial, you should check out LightningTrainer.",

            "generated_answer": " To add a timeout for a Ray job, you can use the `timeout` parameter in the `ray.get()` function. This function is used to retrieve the result of a remote function execution. By specifying a timeout, the function will raise a `GetTimeoutError` if the result is not available within the specified time. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\n@ray.remote\ndef long_running_function():\n    time.sleep(8)\n\nobj_ref = long_running_function.remote()\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)\nexcept GetTimeoutError:\n    print(\"`get` timed out.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `long_running_function` will sleep for 8 seconds. By calling `ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)`, we are asking Ray to retrieve the result of the function execution, but we only want to wait for 4 seconds. If the result is not available within 4 seconds, a `GetTimeoutError` will be raised.\n\nHowever, this method is only suitable for timeout management of a single task. If you want to set a timeout for the entire Ray job, you can consider using the `ray job stop` command to stop the job manually after a certain period of time. Here is an example:\n\n```bash\nray job submit my_job.py --no-wait\nsleep 60  # wait for 60 seconds\nray job stop my_job_id\n```\n\nIn this example, we submit a Ray job using the `ray job submit` command, but we use the `--no-wait` option to prevent Ray from waiting for the job to finish. Then, we use the `sleep` command to wait for 60 seconds, and finally, we use the `ray job stop` command to stop the job. You need to replace `my_job.py` and `my_job_id` with your actual job script and ID.",

The node is still running, which means the problem is not a worker node failure but rather a failure in the health check process.\n\nThe context provided offers some insights into troubleshooting Ray issues, particularly those related to connecting to the head node (GCS). The most common cause of such issues is the worker node's inability to access the IP address or port of the head node. To debug this, you can use the 'ip route get' command on the worker node, targeting the head node's IP address.\n\nAnother possible cause for health check failures is a mismatch in Ray versions between the worker node and the head node. Ensure both nodes are running the same Ray version.\n\nLastly, there could be firewall settings preventing access to the head node. You can use tools like 'nmap' or 'nc' to check whether each port can be reached from a node.\n\nIn summary, to resolve the \"Health check failed for node\" issue:\n\n1. Check if the worker node can access the head node's IP address and port.\n2. Ensure both the worker node and the head node are running the same Ray version.\n3.

By default, Ray spills objects to its temporary directory in the local filesystem. You can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the `object_spilling_config` parameter in the `ray.init()` function. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets that may not fit entirely in memory.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open). It is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. Spilling to multiple remote storages is also supported.",

Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster. This actor can then execute remote method calls and maintain its own internal state.

            "generated_answer": " When using `map_batches` in Ray Data, you can specify the batch format as either NumPy ndarrays or pandas DataFrames by including `batch_format` in the function call. The function you provide to `map_batches` should return data in the same format.\n\nFor example, if you want to increase the brightness of images in a dataset, you can use the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport numpy as np\nimport ray\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> Dict[str, np.ndarray]:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return batch\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness, batch_format=\"numpy\")\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `batch` argument is a dictionary where the values are NumPy ndarrays. The function increases the brightness of the image by adding 4 to each pixel value and then clipping the values to the range [0, 255]. The function returns a dictionary with the same format as the input.\n\nIf you prefer to work with pandas DataFrames, you can modify the function to return a DataFrame instead:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef increase_brightness(batch: Dict[str, np.ndarray]) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    batch[\"image\"] = np.clip(batch[\"image\"] + 4, 0, 255)\n    return pd.DataFrame(batch)\n\nds = (\n    ray.data.read_images(\"s3://anonymous@ray-example-data/image-datasets/simple\")\n    .map_batches(increase_brightness, batch_format=\"pandas\")\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function returns a pandas DataFrame instead of a dictionary. The `map_batches` function will automatically convert the DataFrame to the specified batch format.",

It is an application-level autoscaler that works on top of the Ray Autoscaler, which can request more Ray nodes from the cloud provider if there are not enough available CPUs to place the requested replica actors. The autoscaling decision takes into account user-specified parameters such as `min_replicas`. Ray Serve also provides dynamic request batching to improve service throughput without sacrificing latency. The Ray Autoscaler is a process that runs on the head node and adjusts the number of worker nodes based on task and actor resource requests.",
            "reference_answer": "Autoscaling in a Ray Serve application works by adjusting to traffic spikes through observing queue sizes and making scaling decisions to add or remove replicas. This is configured through the autoscaling_config field in deployment options. The parameters include min_replicas, initial_replicas, max_replicas, and target_num_ongoing_requests_per_replica. The Ray Serve Autoscaler is an application-level autoscaler that asks Ray to start a number of replica actors based on the request demand. If there aren\u2019t enough available CPUs to place these actors, the Ray Autoscaler requests more Ray nodes from the underlying cloud provider. When Ray Serve scales down and terminates some replica actors, it tries to do so in a way that results in the most nodes having no Ray actors or tasks running on them, at which point the Ray autoscaler will remove those nodes.",

It's designed to integrate with Python's NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn libraries, providing a high-level, easy-to-use API for parallel computing. Dask is often used for distributed data processing, machine learning, and scientific computing tasks.\n\nWhen comparing Spark, Ray, and Dask, it's essential to consider the specific use case, programming language preference, and the desired trade-off between ease of use and flexibility. Dask-on-Ray is an ongoing project that combines Dask and Ray, allowing you to use Dask's familiar NumPy and Pandas APIs with Ray's fast, fault-tolerant distributed task execution system. This combination can be useful when you want to leverage Ray's performance while maintaining a high-level, Pythonic API.",

            "generated_answer": " To deploy a large language model (LLM) workload on top of Ray Serve, follow these steps:\n\n1. Write your LLM application as a single Python module, combining prompt preprocessing, vector database lookups, LLM API calls, and response validation. Ray Serve supports any arbitrary Python code, enabling rapid development and easy testing.\n2. Use the `@serve.deployment` decorator to define a deployment in the Python class or function handling incoming requests.\n3. Bind the deployment with optional arguments to the constructor.\n4. Create a Ray Serve config file (e.g., `fruit_config.yaml`) for the deployment.\n5. Deploy the Ray Serve config file using the Ray Serve CLI with the `serve deploy` command, providing the config file path. This can be done on a local, single-node cluster or a remote, multi-node cluster started with the Ray Cluster Launcher.\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\n$ ray start --head\n$ serve deploy fruit_config.yaml\n```\n\nThis will deploy your LLM application to production, and each application step can independently autoscale to efficiently accommodate user traffic without wasting resources. Ray Serve also offers features for batching and integration to improve performance.",
            "reference_answer": "To deploy an LLM workload on top of Ray Serve, you need to follow these steps: \\n1. Initialize Ray with the necessary packages using the `ray.init()` function. \\n2. Define a callable class that will serve as the Serve deployment. This class should include the model loading in its `__init__` method and a method to generate responses based on the input text. \\n3. Bind the deployment with your arguments using the `bind()` method and start it using the `run()` method. \\n4. You can then submit a request to your deployment using a POST request.",

Refer to the Ray documentation on how to address the out-of-memory issue: <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-core/scheduling/ray-oom-prevention.html>.\n3. Monitor the memory usage on the node to ensure it doesn't exceed the available memory. You can do this by using `ray logs raylet.out -ip <node_ip>` and checking the memory usage percentage.\n4.

Overloading the head node with too many simultaneous connections can cause worker nodes to fail to connect. The solution is to start the worker nodes more slowly.\n2. A loop of restarting the RayCluster can occur when the Kubernetes cluster runs out of resources, leading to a lack of connectivity. This issue can be resolved by ensuring that the Kubernetes cluster has sufficient resources to accommodate the serve application.\n3. Head node failure can also cause the entire Ray cluster to fail. To tolerate head node failures, GCS needs to be made fault-tolerant so that when a new head node is started, all the cluster-level data is still available.\n4. Raylet failure can mark the corresponding node as dead, and it will be treated as a new raylet/node to the Ray cluster.\n\nAdditionally, the context suggests that nodes can be stopped when the cluster scales down, and node scaling events can also impact tasks, actors, and objects in a Ray cluster.",
            "reference_answer": "Nodes in a cluster can die due to Out-Of-Memory (OOM) issues. This can occur when application tasks or actors consume a large amount of heap space, causing the node to run out of memory. When this happens, the operating system will start killing worker or raylet processes, disrupting the application.

You can also use the `ray.timeline()` function to profile and debug the Ray application and identify any performance bottlenecks or deadlocks.\n\nBy following these steps, you can debug why Ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`.",
            "reference_answer": "To debug why ray rollout workers are deadlocking when using the sample API in `ray/rllib/evaluation/rollout_worker.py`, you can try setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` if you encounter errors like `blas_thread_init: pthread_create: Resource temporarily unavailable` when using many workers. You can also check configured system limits with `ulimit -a` for other resource limit errors. For unexpected hangs or performance problems, you can use `ray stack` to dump the stack traces of all Ray workers on the current node, `ray timeline` to dump a timeline visualization of tasks to a file, and `ray memory` to list all object references in the cluster. If you are developing with TensorFlow, it is recommended to use `framework=tf2` and `eager_tracing=True` for maximum performance and support. For debugging purposes, you should use `framework=tf2` with `eager_tracing=False`. All `tf.Tensor` values will then be visible and printable when executing your code.",

Retrieval of the actor from any job in the Ray cluster, which is useful if you cannot directly pass the actor handle to the task that needs it or if you are trying to access an actor launched by another driver.\n2. Get-Or-Create option, which allows creating an actor only if it doesn\u2019t exist, and if it does, a handle to the actor will be returned, and the arguments will be ignored.\n3. Specifying a namespace for a named actor while creating it, which allows the actor to belong to the specified namespace, no matter what namespace of the current job is.\n4. Decoupling actor lifetimes from the job, allowing an actor to persist even after the driver process of the job exits (detached actors).\n\nNamed actors are scoped by namespace, and if no namespace is assigned, they will be placed in an anonymous namespace by default.",

It is recommended to use `RuntimeContext.get_actor_id()` instead.\n\nIf you have a named actor, you can also get the actor ID by calling `ray.get_actor(name)`, which returns an `ActorHandle` to the actor.

            "generated_answer": " To kill or cancel a Ray task that you have already started, you can call `ray.cancel()` on the Object Ref returned by the task. This will send a KeyboardInterrupt to the task's worker if it is currently in mid-execution. If you want to force-exit the worker, you can pass `force=True` to `ray.cancel()`. Note that Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled.\n\nHere is an example of how to cancel a Ray task:\n\n```\n@ray.remote\ndef blocking_operation():\n    time.sleep(10e6)\n\nobj_ref = blocking_operation.remote()\nray.cancel(obj_ref)\n\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref)\nexcept ray.exceptions.TaskCancelledError:\n    print(\"Object reference was cancelled.\")\n```\n\nThis cancellation approach aligns with the standards presented in asyncio task cancellation. Note that asyncio.Task won\u2019t be interrupted in the middle of execution if you don\u2019t await within the async function. Ray attempts to cancel Tasks on a best-effort basis, meaning cancellation isn\u2019t always guaranteed. You can check if a Task was successfully cancelled using `ray.get(actor_task_ref)`.\n\nFor Actor Tasks, if the specified Task is pending execution, it is cancelled and not executed. If the Task is currently executing, the behavior depends on the execution model of an Actor. If it is a regular Actor or a threaded Actor, the execution isn\u2019t cancelled. Actor Tasks cannot be interrupted because Actors have states. If it is an async Actor, Ray cancels a asyncio.Task. The semantic of cancellation is equivalent to asyncio\u2019s cancellation. If the Task has finished, nothing happens. Only `force=False` is allowed for an Actor Task. Otherwise, it raises ValueError. Use `ray.kill(actor)` instead to kill an Actor.\n\nTo cancel an Actor Task, you can also call `ray.cancel()` on the returned Object Ref.\n\n```\nimport ray\nimport asyncio\nimport time\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    async def f(self):\n        try:\n            await asyncio.sleep(5)\n        except asyncio.CancelledError:\n            print(\"Actor task canceled.\")\n\nactor = Actor.remote()\nref = actor.f.remote()\n\n# Wait until task is scheduled.\ntime.sleep(1)\nray.cancel(ref)\n```",

However, Ray will not automatically retry tasks that have been cancelled. If there are memory leaks on a worker due to application-level code, you can set the max_calls option in a task\u2019s @ray.remote decorator to make progress.

If your preprocessed Dataset is small enough to fit in Ray object store memory, materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray\u2019s built-in object store by calling `materialize()` on the preprocessed dataset. This will compute the entire preprocessed dataset and pin it in the Ray object store memory, so that when iterating over the dataset repeatedly, the preprocessing operations do not need to be re-run.\n3.

Apply the necessary preprocessing logic to your data using the appropriate Ray Data functions or preprocessors.\n\nHere's an example of how you might use Ray Data to preprocess data for a machine learning training pipeline:\n\n```python\nimport ray\nfrom ray.data.preprocessors import MinMaxScaler\n\n# Load data from multiple files\ndata = ray.data.read_files(\"my_data_files/*.parquet\")\n\n# Preprocess the data\nscaler = MinMaxScaler()\ndata = data.map_batches(scaler.transform)\n\n# Materialize the preprocessed dataset in Ray\u2019s built-in object store (if it fits)\nif data.count() < ray.global_state.memory_size_mb * 0.3:\n    data = data.materialize()\n```\n\nRemember that if your preprocessed data is too large to fit into Ray object store memory, materializing the dataset will decrease performance as data needs to be spilled to and read back from disk.

Instead, you can create a separate actor to manage the global state and pass the actor handle to other actors or tasks.\n\nHere's an example of how you can do this:\n\n1. Create a new actor to manage the global state:\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass GlobalVarActor:\n    def __init__(self, initial_value):\n        self.global_var = initial_value\n\n    def set_global_var(self, var):\n        self.global_var = var\n\n    def get_global_var(self):\n        return self.global_var\n```\n2. Instantiate the `GlobalVarActor` and pass its handle to the actor that needs to access the global state:\n```python\nglobal_var_actor = GlobalVarActor.remote(3)\nactor = Actor.remote(global_var_actor)\n```\n3. Use the `get_global_var` method to access the global state from the `Actor`:\n```python\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    def __init__(self, global_var_actor):\n        self.global_var_actor = global_var_actor\n\n    def f(self):\n        global_var = ray.get(self.global_var_actor.get_global_var.remote())\n        return global_var + 3\n```\nThis way, you can pickle the `global_var_actor` handle and pass it to other actors or tasks that need to access the global state.",

Here's an example of how you can use it:\n\nFirst, define a remote function that performs the allreduce operation on a tensor using a GPU:\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\nclass Worker:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.buffer = cupy.ones((10,), dtype=cupy.float32)\n\n    def compute(self):\n        col.allreduce(self.buffer, \"default\")\n        return self.buffer\n```\nThen, create multiple actors and invoke the `compute` function remotely:\n```python\nA = Worker.remote()\nB = Worker.remote()\n\nray.get([A.compute.remote(), B.compute.remote()])\n```\nThis will perform an allreduce operation on the `buffer` attribute of each actor. Note that you can use `col.allreduce` with any tensor that is on a GPU.\n\nTo perform an allreduce operation on a list of tensors, you can use the `ray.util.collective.allreduce` function directly:\n```python\ntensor_list = [tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]\ngroup_name = \"my_group\"\n\nray.util.collective.allreduce(tensor_list, group_name)\n```\nThis will perform an allreduce operation on each tensor in `tensor_list` and store the results in the same list.

            "generated_answer": " To write unit tests for Ray code, you can follow these tips:\n\n1. Share the Ray cluster across tests if possible to avoid the overhead of creating a new cluster for each test. You can do this by calling `ray.init()` before running any tests and `ray.shutdown()` after all tests have finished.\n2. Fix the resource quantity with `ray.init(num_cpus=...)` to ensure that each test has consistent resources.\n3. Consider creating a mini-cluster with `ray.cluster_utils.Cluster` for more complex tests.\n4. Be careful when running tests in parallel to avoid race conditions and other issues.\n\nHere is an example of how to set up a Ray cluster for unit testing in Python:\n```python\nimport unittest\nimport ray\n\nclass RayTest(unittest.TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        ray.init(num_cpus=4, num_gpus=0)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        ray.shutdown()\n```\nIn this example, a new Ray cluster is created for each test case using the `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods. The `ray.init()` function is used to initialize the cluster with 4 CPUs and 0 GPUs. The `ray.shutdown()` function is called after each test to clean up the cluster and release resources.\n\nNote that it's generally recommended to start a new Ray cluster for each test to avoid potential issues with shared state. However, if you have long-running tests or tests that require a lot of resources, sharing a cluster across tests can help improve performance.",

You can start a new Ray cluster for each test in the setUp method and shut it down in the tearDown method. However, starting and stopping a Ray cluster can add significant latency. To reduce this, you can share the Ray cluster across tests by initializing it in the setUpClass method and shutting it down in the tearDownClass method. Be aware that there are certain cases where it may be unsafe to reuse a Ray cluster across tests, such as if your application depends on setting environment variables per process or if your remote actor/task sets any sort of process-level global variables.",

This will immediately terminate the actor, causing any current, pending, and future tasks to fail. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\ndetached_actor_handle = Actor.options(lifetime=\"detached\").remote()\n\n# Later, when you want to kill the actor\nray.kill(detached_actor_handle)\n```\nKeep in mind that this method will not go through the normal teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `std::atexit` or `atexit` will not be called. Additionally, subsequent calls to get the actor's handle via `ray.get_actor()` will fail.\n\nFor non-detached actors, they will be terminated when all actor handles in Python are deleted, which will cause them to complete any outstanding work and then shut down. If you only have one reference to an actor handle, calling `del actor` could trigger actor deletion.\n\nIn the case of a remote actor, you can use `ray list actors --detail` to see the death cause of dead actors and get more information about why the actor exited.",

This should be reserved for cases where an actor is unexpectedly hanging or leaking resources, and for detached actors, which must be manually destroyed. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass Actor:\n    pass\n\nactor_handle = Actor.remote()\n\nray.kill(actor_handle)\n```\nThis will not go through the normal Python sys.exit teardown logic, so any exit handlers installed in the actor using `atexit` will not be called.",

Here's an example:\n\n1. Create your custom module, e.g., `my_module.py`:\n```python\n# my_module.py\nimport ray\n\n@ray.remote\nclass MyModuleActor:\n    def custom_module_method(self, arg):\n        # Implementation using your custom module\n        from my_module import my_custom_function\n        result = my_custom_function(arg)\n        return result\n```\n\n2. Use the custom module in your Actor:\n```python\n# main.py\nfrom my_module import MyModuleActor\n\n# Instantiate the Actor\nmy_actor = MyModuleActor.remote()\n\n# Call the method using .remote()\nresult = my_actor.custom_module_method.remote(10)\n\n# Get the result\nray.get(result)\n```\n\nIn this example, `my_module.py` contains the custom module with a remote actor class `MyModuleActor`. The actor has a method `custom_module_method` that uses a custom function `my_custom_function` from the module. The `main.py` script imports the `MyModuleActor` class and uses it as an Actor.\n\nKeep in mind that the custom module should be available in the Python environment where Ray is running. If you're using Ray with a cluster, make sure to distribute the custom module to all the nodes in the cluster.",

You can do this by running the `ray dashboard` command followed by the configuration file you used to launch your cluster. For example:\n\n`ray dashboard cluster.yaml`\n\nThis will set up port forwarding automatically and make the remote dashboard viewable in your local browser at localhost:8265.\n\nIf you are using KubeRay, you can also access the dashboard from within the Kubernetes cluster at <http://<RayCluster name>-head-svc:8265>. To expose the dashboard outside the cluster, you can either set up ingress or use port-forwarding.\n\nIt is important to note that for security purposes, you should not expose the Ray Dashboard publicly without proper authentication in place.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, you may want to check the Ray Dashboard configurations, which may differ depending on how you launch Ray Clusters.

This allows you to modify the data and have the changes reflected in all workers.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `ray.train.get_context().get_trial_dir()` function to get the trial directory and save any outputs there. This will ensure that each worker writes to its own unique directory and avoids conflicts.\n\nIt is important to note that the behavior of changing the working directory can be disabled by setting the `RAY_CHDIR_TO_TRIAL_DIR=0` environment variable. This allows access to files in the original working directory, but relative paths should be used for read-only purposes, and you must make sure that the directory is synced on all nodes if running on multiple machines.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the `ray.put()` and `ray.get()` functions to share data between different parts of your application, such as between tasks and actors. This can be useful for sharing data that needs to be accessed by multiple workers or for passing data between different stages of your application.",

It runs on the head node of a Ray cluster. The head node has more memory-demanding system components like GCS or the dashboard, which can cause it to take up a lot of memory. If you're experiencing issues with the GCS server taking up too much memory on the head node, you can try adjusting the memory configuration of the head node or disabling the GCS server from running on the head node.

This involves automatically dropping into the debugger when an error occurs or an exception is thrown. Here's how you can set this up:\n\n1. Install the required dependencies:\n```\npip install \"ray[serve]\" scikit-learn\n```\n2. Create a file called `serve_debugging.py` and add the following code:\n```python\nimport time\n\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n\nimport ray\nfrom ray import serve\n\nserve.start()\n```\n3. In this example, an uncaught exception is not intentionally thrown. However, if you have a specific function where you expect an uncaught exception, you can use a Python `try`/`except` block to catch and handle the exception as needed.\n4. To verify the status of the Serve application, you can use the Ray dashboard. Forward the dashboard port to localhost and check the Serve page in the Ray dashboard at `http://localhost:8265/#/serve`.\n\nIf an uncaught exception occurs, Ray Serve will surface the failure as a Python-level exception. The original exception will be wrapped in a `RayTaskError` and stored as the task's return value. This wrapped exception will be thrown to any worker that tries to get the result.\n\nFor more information on Ray exceptions, you can refer to the Ray exceptions documentation.",

This function allows you to restore the experiment from a local path or a cloud storage bucket. You can specify the `resume_errored` option to true if you want to resume an experiment that was interrupted due to an error.\n\nHere is an example of how to use `Tuner.restore()` to restore an experiment from a local path:\n```\ntuner = tune.Tuner.restore(\n    os.path.expanduser(\"~/ray_results/tune_fault_tolerance_guide\"),\n    trainable=trainable,\n    resume_errored=True,\n)\ntuner.fit()\n```\nAnd here is an example of how to restore an experiment from a cloud storage bucket:\n```\ntuner = tune.Tuner.restore(\n    \"s3://my-checkpoints-bucket/path/my-tune-exp\",\n    trainable=my_trainable,\n    resume_errored=True\n)\ntuner.fit()\n```\nYou can also specify the `resume_unfinished` or `restart_errored` options to control how the experiment is restored. For more details, please see the documentation of `Tuner.restore()`.\n\nOnce the experiment is restored, you can access the results and checkpoints by calling `Tuner.get_results()` to receive the `ResultGrid` object, and then proceeding as outlined in the Tune documentation.\n\nNote that if you ran your initial experiment with cloud checkpointing, you will need to download all the checkpoints to your local machine before you can analyze them. You can do this by copying the checkpoint files from the cloud storage bucket to your local machine using a tool like the `aws s3 cp` command or the `gsutil cp` command.",

            "generated_answer": " To make the GPU available on your M1 laptop for Ray, you need to install Ray on a machine running Apple Silicon (such as an M1 Mac) using miniforge. Here are the steps:\n\n1. Install miniforge.\n2. Activate the miniforge environment.\n3. Install Ray as you normally would.\n\nTo use the GPU with Ray, you can define a Ray remote function with `num_gpus=1` and use TensorFlow or another external library that supports GPU acceleration. Here's an example:\n```python\n@ray.remote(num_gpus=1)\ndef use_gpu():\n    import tensorflow as tf\n    # Use TensorFlow to utilize the GPU\n```\nNote that you will need to install the GPU version of TensorFlow for this to work. Also, keep in mind that if you are using fractional GPUs, it is your responsibility to ensure that multiple trials can share GPUs and there is enough memory to do so. Ray does not automatically handle this for you.\n\nTo request GPUs, you can use the `ray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources` function to scale up GPU resources. Here's an example:\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(bundles=[{\"GPU\": 1}] * 2)\n```\nAfter the nodes are scaled up, they will persist until the request is explicitly overridden. To remove the resource request, you can use the following program:\n```python\nimport ray\n\nray.init()\nray.autoscaler.sdk.request_resources(bundles=[])\n```\nThe GPU workers can then scale down.\n\nTo configure Ray pods for GPU usage, you need to specify `nvidia.com/gpu` resource limits and requests in the container fields of your RayCluster\u2019s headGroupSpec and/or workerGroupSpecs. Here's a config snippet for a RayCluster workerGroup of up to 5 GPU workers:\n```yaml\ngroupName: gpu-group\nreplicas: 0\nminReplicas: 0\nmaxReplicas: 5\n...\ntemplate:\n    spec:\n     ...\n     containers:\n      - name: ray-node\n        image: rayproject/ray-ml:2.6.3-gpu\n        ...\n        resources:\n         nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Optional, included just for documentation.\n         cpu: 3\n         memory: 50Gi\n        limits:\n         nvidia.com/gpu: 1 # Required to use GPU.\n         cpu: 3\n```\nNote that using Nvidia GPUs requires specifying `nvidia.com/gpu` resource limits and requests in the container fields of your RayCluster\u2019s headGroupSpec and/or workerGroupSpecs.\n\nTo access the dashboard, use `ray[default]`, `ray[air]`, or other installation commands that include the Ray Dashboard component. When you start a single-node Ray Cluster on your laptop, access the dashboard with the URL that Ray prints when it initializes (the default URL is <http://localhost:8265>) or with the context object returned by `ray.init()`.\n\nTo wait for GPU availability, you can use `ray.tune.utils.wait_for_gpu` function. Here's an example:\n```python\nray.tune.utils.wait_for_gpu(gpu_id=0, target_util=0.01, retry=20, delay_s=5, gpu_memory_limit=None)\n```\nThis function checks if a given GPU has freed memory and requires `gputil` to be installed. It blocks until the GPU is completely free if `target_util` is set to 0.",

            "question": "How can I add a timeout for the Ray job?",
            "generated_answer": " To add a timeout for a Ray job, you can use the `timeout` parameter in the `ray.get()` function. This function is used to retrieve the result of a remote function execution. By specifying a timeout, the function will raise a `GetTimeoutError` if the result is not available within the specified time. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nfrom ray.exceptions import GetTimeoutError\n\n@ray.remote\ndef long_running_function():\n    time.sleep(8)\n\nobj_ref = long_running_function.remote()\ntry:\n    ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)\nexcept GetTimeoutError:\n    print(\"`get` timed out.\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `long_running_function` will sleep for 8 seconds. By calling `ray.get(obj_ref, timeout=4)`, we are asking Ray to retrieve the result of the function execution, but we only want to wait for 4 seconds. If the result is not available within 4 seconds, a `GetTimeoutError` will be raised.\n\nHowever, this method only works for individual task level timeout. If you want to set a timeout for the whole Ray job, you can consider using the `ray job stop` command to stop the job manually after a certain period of time. Here is an example:\n\n```bash\nray job submit my_job & # submit the job in the background\nsleep 300 # wait for 300 seconds\nray job stop my_job # stop the job\n```\n\nIn this example, we submit the Ray job in the background and then use the `sleep` command to wait for 300 seconds. After 300 seconds, we use the `ray job stop` command to stop the job. Note that this method will stop the whole Ray job, not just a single task.",

You can collect logs written to a pod\u2019s filesystem using one of two logging strategies: sidecar containers or daemonsets. For sidecar containers, you can process logs by configuring a log-processing sidecar for each Ray pod. Ray containers should be configured to share the /tmp/ray directory with the logging sidecar via a volume mount. For daemonsets, you can collect logs at the Kubernetes node level by deploying a log-processing daemonset onto the Kubernetes cluster\u2019s nodes.

By default, objects are spilled to Ray's temporary directory in the local filesystem. You can configure the directory where objects are spilled to by using the `object_spilling_config` parameter in the `ray.init()` function.\n\nHere's an example of how to configure the directory for object spilling:\n```python\nimport json\nimport ray\n\nray.init(\n    _system_config={\n        \"object_spilling_config\": json.dumps(\n            {\n                \"type\": \"filesystem\",\n                \"params\": {\"directory_path\": \"/path/to/spill\"},\n            }\n        )\n    },\n)\n```\nIt is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended to specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling.",
            "reference_answer": "To avoid objects not getting spilled in Ray, you can configure the directory where objects are spilled to. You can also specify multiple directories for spilling to spread the IO load and disk space usage across multiple physical devices if needed. To optimize the performance, it is recommended to use an SSD instead of an HDD when using object spilling for memory-intensive workloads. If you are using an HDD, it is recommended that you specify a large buffer size (> 1MB) to reduce IO requests during spilling. To prevent running out of disk space, local object spilling will throw OutOfDiskError if the disk utilization exceeds the predefined threshold. You can adjust the threshold by setting local_fs_capacity_threshold, or set it to 1 to disable the protection. You can also enable object spilling to remote storage (any URI supported by smart_open).

Ray also provides actors to parallelize computation across multiple actor instances. When you instantiate a class that is a Ray actor, Ray will start a remote instance of that class in the cluster.
